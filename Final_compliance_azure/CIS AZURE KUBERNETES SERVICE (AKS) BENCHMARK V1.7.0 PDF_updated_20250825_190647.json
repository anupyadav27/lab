You create and manage the nodes that run the kubelet and container runtime, and deploy your applications through the managed Kubernetes API server. To help troubleshoot your application and services, you may need to view the logs generated by these control plane components. To help collect and review data from multiple sources, Azure Monitor logs provides a query language and analytics engine that provides insights to your environment. A workspace is used to collate and analyze the data, and can integrate with other Azure services such as Application Insights and Security Center.",

Select the resource group for your AKS cluster, such as myResourceGroup. Don't select the resource group that contains your individual AKS cluster resources, such as MC_myResourceGroup_myAKSCluster_eastus. 2. On the left-hand side, choose Diagnostic settings. 3. Select your AKS cluster, such as myAKSCluster, then choose to Add diagnostic setting. 4. Enter a name, such as myAKSClusterLogs, then select the option to Send to Log Analytics. 5. Select an existing workspace or create a new one. If you create a workspace, provide a workspace name, a resource group, and a location. 6. In the list of available logs, select the logs you wish to enable. For this example, enable the kube-audit and kube-audit-admin logs. Common logs include the kube-apiserver, kube-controller-manager, and kube-scheduler. You can return and change the collected logs once Log Analytics workspaces are enabled. 7. When ready, select Save to enable collection of the selected logs. Default Value: By default, cluster control plane logs aren't sent to be Logged.

Built on decades of enterprise identity management, Azure AD is a multi-tenant, cloud-based directory, and identity management service that combines core directory services, application access management, and identity protection. With Azure AD, you can integrate on-premises identities into AKS clusters to provide a single source for account management and security. Azure Active Directory integration with AKS clusters With Azure AD-integrated AKS clusters, you can grant users or groups access to Kubernetes resources within a namespace or across the cluster. To obtain a kubectl configuration context, a user can run the az aks get-credentials command. When a user then interacts with the AKS cluster with kubectl, they're prompted to sign in with their Azure AD credentials. This approach provides a single source for user account management and password credentials. The user can only access the resources as defined by the cluster administrator. Azure AD authentication is provided to AKS clusters with OpenID Connect. OpenID Connect is an identity layer built on top of the OAuth 2.0 protocol. For more information on OpenID Connect, see the Open ID connect documentation. From inside of the Kubernetes cluster, Webhook Token Authentication is used to verify authentication tokens. Webhook token authentication is configured and managed as part of the AKS cluster.

Kubernetes Engine uses both Transport Layer Security (TLS) and authentication to provide secure access to your cluster's control plane from the public internet. This provides you the flexibility to administer your cluster from anywhere; however, you might want to further restrict access to a set of IP addresses that you control. You can set this restriction by specifying an authorized network. Restricting access to an authorized network can provide additional security benefits for your container cluster, including: • Better protection from outsider attacks: Authorized networks provide an additional layer of security by limiting external access to a specific set of addresses you designate, such as those that originate from your premises. This helps protect access to your cluster in the case of a vulnerability in the cluster's authentication or authorization mechanism. • Better protection from insider attacks: Authorized networks help protect your cluster from accidental leaks of master certificates from your company's premises. Leaked certificates used from outside Azure virtual machines and outside the authorized IP ranges (for example, from addresses outside your company) are still denied access.

    "description": "The ability to manage RBAC for Kubernetes resources from Azure gives you the choice to manage RBAC for the cluster resources either using Azure or native Kubernetes mechanisms. When enabled, Azure AD principals will be validated exclusively by Azure RBAC while regular Kubernetes users and service accounts are exclusively validated by Kubernetes RBAC. Azure role-based access control (RBAC) is an authorization system built on Azure Resource Manager that provides fine-grained access management of Azure resources. With Azure RBAC, you create a role definition that outlines the permissions to be applied. You then assign a user or group this role definition via a role assignment for a particular scope. The scope can be an individual resource, a resource group, or across the subscription.",
    "rationale": "Today you can already leverage integrated authentication between Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) and AKS. When enabled, this integration allows customers to use Azure AD users, groups, or service principals as subjects in Kubernetes RBAC. This feature frees you from having to separately manage user identities and credentials for Kubernetes. However, you still have to set up and manage Azure RBAC and Kubernetes RBAC separately. Azure RBAC for Kubernetes Authorization is an approach that allows for the unified management and access control across Azure Resources, AKS, and Kubernetes resources.",
