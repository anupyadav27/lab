Additionally, services, protocols, and ports that are enabled but not in use are often overlooked and left unsecured and unpatched. By identifying the services, protocols, and ports necessary for business, entities can ensure that all other services, protocols, and ports are disabled or removed.",

    "Purpose": "Such a review gives the organization an opportunity to clean up any unneeded, outdated, or incorrect rules and configurations which could be utilized by an unauthorized person. Furthermore, it ensures that all rules and configurations allow only authorized services, protocols, and ports that match the documented business justifications.",

    "GoodPractice": "System components that provide publicly accessible services, such as email, web, and DNS servers, are the most vulnerable to threats originating from untrusted networks. Ideally, such systems are placed within a dedicated trusted network that is public facing (for example, a DMZ) but that is separated via NSCs from more sensitive internal systems, which helps protect the rest of the network in the event these externally accessible systems are compromised. This functionality is intended to prevent malicious actors from accessing the organization's internal network from the Internet, or from using services, protocols, or ports in an unauthorized manner. Where this functionality is provided as a built-in feature of an NSC, the entity should ensure that its configurations do not result in the functionality being disabled or bypassed.",

    "Purpose": "Cardholder data that is directly accessible from an untrusted network, for example, because it is stored on a system within the DMZ or in a cloud database service, is easier for an external attacker to access because there are fewer defensive layers to penetrate.

Use of security controls such as host-based controls (for example, personal firewall software or end-point protection solutions), network-based security controls (for example, firewalls, network-based heuristics inspection, and malware simulation), or hardware, helps to protect devices from Internet-based attacks, which could use the device to gain access to the organization’s systems and data when the device reconnects to the network.",

Where there is a legitimate need to temporarily disable security controls on a company-owned or employee-owned device that connects to both an untrusted network and the CDE—for example, to support a specific maintenance activity or investigation of a technical problem—the reason for taking such action is understood and approved by an appropriate management representative. Any disabling or altering of these security controls, including on administrators’ own devices, is performed by authorized personnel. It is recognized that administrators have privileges that may allow them to disable security controls on their own computers, but there should be alerting mechanisms in place when such controls are disabled and follow up that occurs to ensure processes were followed.",
    "Examples": "Practices include forbidding split-tunneling of VPNs for employee-owned or corporate-owned mobile devices and requiring that such devices boot up into a VPN. These security controls may be temporarily disabled only if there is legitimate technical need, as authorized by management on a case-by-case basis. If these security controls need to be disabled for a specific purpose, it must be formally authorized. Additional security measures may also need to be implemented for the period during which these security controls are not active.

    "GoodPractice": "The network and data-flow diagrams defined in Requirement 1 are useful resources for identifying all connection points where account data is transmitted or received over open, public networks. While not required, it is considered a good practice for entities to also encrypt PAN over their internal networks, and for entities to establish any new network implementations with encrypted communications. PAN transmissions can be protected by encrypting the data before it is transmitted, or by encrypting the session over which the data is transmitted, or both. While it is not required that strong cryptography be applied at both the data level and the session level, it is strongly recommended. If encrypted at the data level, the cryptographic keys used for protecting the data can be managed in accordance with Requirements 3.6 and 3.7. If the data is encrypted at the session level, designated key custodians should be assigned responsibility for managing transmission keys and certificates.",
    "CustomizedApproachObjective": "Cleartext PAN cannot be read or intercepted from any transmissions over open, public networks.",
    "ApplicabilityNotes": "Some protocol implementations (such as SSL, SSH v1.0, and early TLS) have known vulnerabilities that an attacker can use to gain access to the cleartext data. It is critical that entities maintain awareness of industry-defined deprecation dates for the cipher suites they are using and are prepared to migrate to newer versions or protocols when older ones are no longer deemed secure. Verifying that certificates are trusted helps ensure the integrity of the secure connection. To be considered trusted, a certificate should be issued from a trusted source, such as a trusted certificate authority (CA), and not be expired. Up-to-date Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs) or Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) can be used to validate certificates. Techniques to validate certificates may include certificate and public key pinning, where the trusted certificate or a public key is pinned either during development or upon its first use. Entities can also confirm with developers or review source code to ensure that clients and servers reject connections if the certificate is bad. For browser-based TLS certificates, certificate trust can often be verified by clicking on the lock icon that appears next to the address bar. A self-signed certificate may also be acceptable if the certificate is issued by an internal CA within the organization, the certificate’s author is confirmed, and the certificate is verified—for example, via hash or signature—and has not expired. The bullet above (for confirming that certificates used to safeguard PAN during transmission over open, public networks are valid and are not expired or revoked) is a best practice until 31 March 2025, after which it will be required as part of Requirement 4.2.1 and must be fully considered during a PCI DSS assessment.",

    "Purpose": "Regular inspections of devices will help organizations detect tampering more quickly via external evidence—for example, the addition of a card skimmer—or replacement of a device, thereby minimizing the potential impact of using fraudulent devices.",
    "GoodPractice": "Methods for periodic inspection include checking the serial number or other device characteristics and comparing the information to the list of POI devices to verify the device has not been swapped with a fraudulent device.",
    "Examples": "The type of inspection will depend on the device. For instance, photographs of devices known to be secure can be used to compare a device’s current appearance with its original appearance to see whether it has changed. Another option may be to use a secure marker pen, such as a UV light marker, to mark device surfaces and device openings so any tampering or replacement will be apparent. Criminals will often replace the outer casing of a device to hide their tampering, and these methods may help to detect such activities. Device vendors may also provide security guidance and 'how to' guides to help determine whether the device has been subject to tampering. Signs that a device might have been tampered with or substituted include: unexpected attachments or cables plugged into the device, missing or changed security labels, broken or differently colored casing, changes to the serial number or other external markings.",

To be effective, the level of screening should be appropriate for the position.
