While disk or partition encryption may still be present on these types of devices, it cannot be the only mechanism used to protect PAN stored on those systems. Any stored PAN must also be rendered unreadable per Requirement 3.5.1\u2014for example, through truncation or a data-level encryption mechanism. Full disk encryption helps to protect data in the event of physical loss of a disk and therefore its use is appropriate only for removable electronic media storage devices. Media that is part of a data center architecture (for example, hot-swappable drives, bulk tape-backups) is considered non-removable electronic media to which Requirement 3.5.1 applies.

While not required, it is considered a good practice for entities to also encrypt PAN over their internal networks, and for entities to establish any new network implementations with encrypted communications. PAN transmissions can be protected by encrypting the data before it is transmitted, or by encrypting the session over which the data is transmitted, or both. While it is not required that strong cryptography be applied at both the data level and the session level, it is strongly recommended. If encrypted at the data level, the cryptographic keys used for protecting the data can be managed in accordance with Requirements 3.6 and 3.7. If the data is encrypted at the session level, designated key custodians should be assigned responsibility for managing transmission keys and certificates.",

    "ApplicabilityNotes": "Some protocol implementations (such as SSL, SSH v1.0, and early TLS) have known vulnerabilities that an attacker can use to gain access to the cleartext data. It is critical that entities maintain awareness of industry-defined deprecation dates for the cipher suites they are using and are prepared to migrate to newer versions or protocols when older ones are no longer deemed secure. Verifying that certificates are trusted helps ensure the integrity of the secure connection. To be considered trusted, a certificate should be issued from a trusted source, such as a trusted certificate authority (CA), and not be expired. Up-to-date Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs) or Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) can be used to validate certificates. Techniques to validate certificates may include certificate and public key pinning, where the trusted certificate or a public key is pinned either during development or upon its first use. Entities can also confirm with developers or review source code to ensure that clients and servers reject connections if the certificate is bad. For browser-based TLS certificates, certificate trust can often be verified by clicking on the lock icon that appears next to the address bar. A self-signed certificate may also be acceptable if the certificate is issued by an internal CA within the organization, the certificate\u2019s author is confirmed, and the certificate is verified\u2014for example, via hash or signature\u2014and has not expired.

    "DefinedApproachTestingProcedures": "7.2.1.a Examine documented policies and procedures and interview personnel to verify the access control model is defined in accordance with all elements specified in this requirement.  \n7.2.1.b Examine access control model settings and verify that access needs are appropriately defined in accordance with all elements specified in this requirement.",
    "Purpose": "Defining an access control model that is appropriate for the entity\u2019s technology and access control philosophy supports a consistent and uniform way of allocating access and reduces the possibility of errors such as the granting of excessive rights.",
    "GoodPractice": "A factor to consider when defining access needs is the separation of duties principle. This principle is intended to prevent fraud and misuse or theft of resources. For example, 1) dividing mission-critical functions and information system support functions among different individuals and/or functions, 2) establishing roles such that information system support activities are performed by different functions/individuals (for example, system management, programming, configuration management, quality assurance and testing, and network security), and 3) ensuring security personnel administering access control functions do not also administer audit functions. In environments where one individual performs multiple functions, such as administration and security operations, duties may be assigned so that no single individual has end-to-end control of a process without an independent checkpoint. For example, responsibility for configuration and responsibility for approving changes could be assigned to separate individuals.",
    "Definitions": "Key elements of an access control model include:  \n\u2022 Resources to be protected (the systems/devices/data to which access is needed),  \n\u2022 Job functions that need access to the resource (for example, system administrator, call-center personnel, store clerk), and  \n\u2022 Which activities each job function needs to perform (for example, read/write or query).  \nOnce job functions, resources, and activities per job functions are defined, individuals can be granted access accordingly.",
    "Examples": "Access control models that entities can consider include role-based access control (RBAC) and attribute-based access control (ABAC). The access control model used by a given entity depends on their business and access needs.",

    "GoodPractice": "Access rights are granted to a user by assignment to one or several functions. Access is assigned depending on the specific user functions and with the minimum scope required for the job. When assigning privileged access, it is important to assign individuals only the privileges they need to perform their job (the 'least privileges'). For example, the database administrator or backup administrator should not be assigned the same privileges as the overall systems administrator. Once needs are defined for user functions (per PCI DSS requirement 7.2.1), it is easy to grant individuals access according to their job classification and function by using the already-created roles.

    "GoodPractice": "The lessons-learned exercise should include all levels of personnel. Although it is often included as part of the review of the entire incident, it should focus on how the entity\u2019s response to the incident could be improved. It is important to not just consider elements of the response that did not have the planned outcomes but also to understand what worked well and whether lessons from those elements that worked well can be applied to areas of the plan that did not. Another way to optimize an entity\u2019s incident response plan is to understand the attacks made against other organizations and use that information to fine-tune the entity\u2019s detection, containment, mitigation, or recovery procedures.",

    "RequirementID": "12.10.7",
    "DefinedApproachRequirements": "Incident response procedures are in place, to be initiated upon the detection of stored PAN anywhere it is not expected, and include:\n\u2022 Determining what to do if PAN is discovered outside the CDE, including its retrieval, secure deletion, and/or migration into the currently defined CDE, as applicable.\n\u2022 Identifying whether sensitive authentication data is stored with PAN.\n\u2022 Determining where the account data came from and how it ended up where it was not expected.\n\u2022 Remediating data leaks or process gaps that resulted in the account data being where it was not expected.",
    "DefinedApproachTestingProcedures": "12.10.7.a Examine documented incident response procedures to verify that procedures for responding to the detection of stored PAN anywhere it is not expected exist, are ready to be initiated, and include all elements specified in this requirement. 12.10.7.b Interview personnel and examine records of response actions to verify that incident response procedures are performed upon detection of stored PAN anywhere it is not expected.",
    "Purpose": "Having documented incident response procedures that are followed in the event that stored PAN is found anywhere it is not expected, helps to identify the necessary remediation actions and prevent future leaks.",
    "GoodPractice": "If PAN was found outside the CDE, analysis should be performed to 1) determine whether it was saved independently of other data or with sensitive authentication data, 2) identify the source of the data, and 3) identify the control gaps that resulted in the data being outside the CDE. Entities should consider whether there are contributory factors, such as business processes, user behavior, improper system configurations, etc. that caused the PAN to be stored in an unexpected location. If such contributory factors are present, they should be addressed per this Requirement to prevent recurrence.",

    "CustomizedApproachObjective": "Processes are in place to quickly respond, analyze, and address situations in the event that cleartext PAN is detected where it is not expected.",
    "ApplicabilityNotes": "This requirement is a best practice until 31 March 2025, after which it will be required and must be fully considered during a PCI DSS assessment.",
