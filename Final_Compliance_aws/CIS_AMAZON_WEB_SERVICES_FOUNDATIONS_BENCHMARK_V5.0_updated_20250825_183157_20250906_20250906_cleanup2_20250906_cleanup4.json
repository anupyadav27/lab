Contact details should not be for a single individual, as circumstances may arise where that individual is unavailable. Email contact details should point to a mail alias which forwards email to multiple individuals within the organization; where feasible, phone contact details should point to a PABX hunt group or other call-forwarding system.",

If this is unsuccessful and the account behavior needs urgent mitigation, proactive measures may be taken, including throttling of traffic between the account exhibiting suspicious behavior and the AWS API endpoints and the Internet. This will result in impaired service to and from the account in question, so it is in both the customers' and AWS's best interests that prompt contact can be established. This is best achieved by setting AWS account contact details to point to resources which have multiple individuals as recipients, such as email aliases and PABX hunt groups.",

If the virtual MFA application supports multiple accounts (multiple virtual MFA devices), choose the option to create a new account (a new virtual MFA device). 7. Determine whether the MFA app supports QR codes, and then do one of the following: o Use the app to scan the QR code. For example, you might choose the camera icon or choose an option similar to Scan code, and then use the device's camera to scan the code. o In the Manage MFA Device wizard, choose Show secret key for manual configuration, and then type the secret configuration key into your MFA application.

For example, you might choose the camera icon or choose an option similar to Scan code, and then use the device's camera to scan the code. \u2022 In the Manage MFA Device wizard, choose Show secret key for manual configuration, and then type the secret configuration key into your MFA application.

Under the navigation panel, on the RDS dashboard, click Databases. 3. Select the RDS instance that you want to examine. 4. Click Instance Name from the dashboard, under Connectivity and Security. 5. In the Security section, check if the Publicly Accessible flag status is set to Yes. 6. Follow the steps below to check database subnet access: \u2022 In the networking section, click the subnet link under Subnets. \u2022 The link will redirect you to the VPC Subnets page. \u2022 Select the subnet listed on the page and click the Route Table tab from the dashboard bottom panel. \u2022 If the route table contains any entries with the destination CIDR block set to 0.0.0.0/0 and an Internet Gateway attached, the selected RDS database instance was provisioned inside a public subnet; therefore, it is not running within a logically isolated environment and can be accessed from the Internet.  7.

If a security group is not specified when an instance is launched, it is automatically assigned to this default security group. Security groups provide stateful filtering of ingress/egress network traffic to AWS resources. It is recommended that the default security group restrict all traffic, both inbound and outbound. The default VPC in every region should have its default security group updated to comply with the following: \u2022 No inbound rules. \u2022 No outbound rules. Any newly created VPCs will automatically contain a default security group that will need remediation to comply with this recommendation. Note: When implementing this recommendation, VPC flow logging is invaluable in determining the least privilege port access required by systems to work properly, as it can log all packet acceptances and rejections occurring under the current security groups. This dramatically reduces the primary barrier to least privilege engineering by discovering the minimum ports required by systems in the environment. Even if the VPC flow logging recommendation in this benchmark is not adopted as a permanent security measure, it should be used during any period of discovery and engineering for least privileged security groups.",
