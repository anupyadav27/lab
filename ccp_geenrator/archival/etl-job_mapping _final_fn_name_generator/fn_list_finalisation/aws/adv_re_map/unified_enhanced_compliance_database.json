EBS can be used as a hard drive that’s mounted on an EC2 instance (virtual machine). EBS can store data as a standalone apart from EC2. This means that data can persist to the block storage service while an EC2 instance is offline. Out of the box EBS functions as an unformatted file system that needs to be configured and mounted on top of an EC2 instance. EBS can be used as both a storage and boot drive; for the purposes of this document, we will focus on EBS as a storage device. EBS comes with many different options to fit the specific needs of an application. EBS is most likely the right choice if you need quick access to read and write files to the cloud and you need these files to be stored long term. You can also rapidly unmount the file system from one EC2 instance and deploy it to another instance by using snapshots.",

Any applications and tools that still use the original access key will stop working at this point because they no longer have access to AWS resources.

If a security group is not specified when an instance is launched, it is automatically assigned to this default security group. Security groups provide stateful filtering of ingress/egress network traffic to AWS resources. It is recommended that the default security group restrict all traffic, both inbound and outbound. The default VPC in every region should have its default security group updated to comply with the following: • No inbound rules. • No outbound rules. Any newly created VPCs will automatically contain a default security group that will need remediation to comply with this recommendation. Note: When implementing this recommendation, VPC flow logging is invaluable in determining the least privilege port access required by systems to work properly, as it can log all packet acceptances and rejections occurring under the current security groups. This dramatically reduces the primary barrier to least privilege engineering by discovering the minimum ports required by systems in the environment. Even if the VPC flow logging recommendation in this benchmark is not adopted as a permanent security measure, it should be used during any period of discovery and engineering for least privileged security groups.",

Enabling VPC flow logging (for accepted connections) in an existing environment that is known to be breach-free will reveal the current pattern of ports being used for each instance to communicate successfully.

More specifically, to route traffic between two or more VPCs via a Transit Gateway, VPCs must have an attachment to a Transit Gateway route table as well as a route. Therefore, to avoid routing traffic between VPCs, an attachment to the Transit Gateway route table should only be added where there is an intention to route traffic between the VPCs. As Transit Gateways are capable of hosting multiple route tables, it is possible to group VPCs by attaching them to a common route table.",

More specifically, to route traffic between two or more VPCs via a Transit Gateway, VPCs must have an attachment to a Transit Gateway route table as well as a route. Therefore, to avoid routing traffic between VPCs, an attachment to the Transit Gateway route table should only be added where there is an intention to route traffic between the VPCs. As Transit Gateways are capable of hosting multiple route tables, it is possible to group VPCs by attaching them to a common route table.",

          "description": "Amazon EKS has introduced the Cluster Access Manager API to streamline and enhance the management of access controls within EKS clusters. This new approach is now the recommended method over the traditional aws-auth ConfigMap for managing Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) and Service Accounts. Key Advantages of Using the Cluster Access Manager API: 1. Simplified Access Management: The Cluster Access Manager API allows administrators to manage access directly through the Amazon EKS API, eliminating the need to modify the aws-auth ConfigMap manually. This reduces operational overhead and minimizes the risk of misconfigurations. 2. Enhanced Security Controls: With this API, administrators can assign predefined AWS-managed Kubernetes permissions, known as \"access policies,\" to IAM principals. This provides a more secure and auditable way to manage permissions compared to manual ConfigMap edits. 3. Improved Visibility and Auditing: The API offers better visibility into cluster access configurations, facilitating easier auditing and compliance checks. Administrators can list and describe access entries and policies directly through the EKS API.",
          "rationale": "The compelling rationale for using the Cluster Access Manager API instead of the traditional aws-auth ConfigMap in Amazon EKS revolves around security, scalability, operational efficiency, and simplified management. 1. Increased Security and Reduced Risk • Direct Management via API: The Cluster Access Manager API enables you to manage RBAC and IAM permissions directly through the EKS API rather than editing a ConfigMap. This eliminates the risk of inadvertent errors when manually modifying the aws-auth ConfigMap. • Immutable Access Entries: The API ensures that once access entries are defined, they are tightly controlled, reducing the risk of accidental overwrites or misconfigurations that can happen when editing YAML files. • Fine-Grained Access Control: By leveraging the new API, you can define access policies at a more granular level than the previous method. This ensures that only the necessary permissions are granted, minimizing the attack surface. 2. Operational Efficiency and Scalability • Scalability: Managing access control through the aws-auth ConfigMap becomes increasingly challenging as the number of users and services grows. The new API scales better by allowing access management through standard AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) tools. • Reduced Operational Overhead: The API simplifies the management of access controls by removing the need for manual updates to the ConfigMap, reducing the risk of human error, and automating access provisioning through Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tools like Terraform or CloudFormation. 3. Improved Visibility, Auditing, and Compliance • Auditable and Traceable Changes: The Cluster Access Manager API integrates with AWS CloudTrail, allowing you to track who made changes to access configurations. This level of visibility is critical for organizations that need to adhere to compliance frameworks like SOC 2, GDPR, or HIPAA. • Centralized Management: Unlike the aws-auth ConfigMap, which is managed at the Kubernetes level, the new API leverages AWS IAM’s centralized management and auditing capabilities, providing a unified view of access controls across your AWS environment. 4. Faster and Safer Access Provisioning • No More Cluster Downtime: Errors in the aws-auth ConfigMap can accidentally lock out users or admins from the cluster, requiring complex recovery processes. The API-based approach is more resilient, reducing the risk of misconfigurations causing downtime. • Immediate Effect: Changes made via the API take effect immediately, whereas updates to the aws-auth ConfigMap may require a delay or even restarting components in some cases. 5. Future-Proofing and Alignment with AWS Best Practices • Native Support in Kubernetes Versions: Starting from Kubernetes 1.23, the Cluster Access Manager API is fully supported and designed to replace the aws- auth ConfigMap method. This aligns with AWS’s roadmap and best practices for EKS, ensuring your infrastructure remains compatible with future updates. • Modern Approach for Pod Identity: When combined with IAM Roles for Service Accounts (IRSA) or the new Pod Identity feature, the API supports a more dynamic and secure model for assigning permissions to pods, making it easier to implement least-privilege access. Impact: The shift to using the Cluster Access Manager API instead of the aws-auth ConfigMap impacts EKS RBAC and Service Accounts by simplifying access control management, reducing the risk of misconfigurations, and enhancing security. It allows for more granular, direct management of IAM permissions and Kubernetes roles, eliminating manual ConfigMap edits and reducing operational overhead. For Service Accounts, it better integrates with existing mechanisms like IAM Roles for Service Accounts (IRSA) for secure pod access to AWS resources, making it easier to enforce least-privilege principles. This transition improves scalability, auditing, and compliance, while providing a future-proof solution aligned with AWS’s Kubernetes identity management roadmap.",

The only requirement is to enable the encryption provider support during EKS cluster creation. Use AWS Key Management Service (KMS) keys to provide envelope encryption of Kubernetes secrets stored in Amazon EKS. Implementing envelope encryption is considered a security best practice for applications that store sensitive data and is part of a defense in depth security strategy. Application-layer Secrets Encryption provides an additional layer of security for sensitive data, such as user defined Secrets and Secrets required for the operation of the cluster, such as service account keys, which are all stored in etcd. Using this functionality, you can use a key, that you manage in AWS KMS, to encrypt data at the application layer.

You can set this restriction by specifying an authorized network. Restricting access to an authorized network can provide additional security benefits for your container cluster, including: • Better protection from outsider attacks: Authorized networks provide an additional layer of security by limiting external access to a specific set of addresses you designate, such as those that originate from your premises. This helps protect access to your cluster in the case of a vulnerability in the cluster's authentication or authorization mechanism. • Better protection from insider attacks: Authorized networks help protect your cluster from accidental leaks of master certificates from your company's premises. Leaked certificates used from outside Cloud Services and outside the authorized IP ranges (for example, from addresses outside your company) are still denied access.

The initial audit log storage is only used in a transitory fashion until the system can communicate with the secondary or alternate system allocated to audit log storage, at which point the audit logs are transferred. Transferring audit logs to alternate storage is similar to AU-9(2) in that audit logs are transferred to a different entity. However, the purpose of selecting AU-9(2) is to protect the confidentiality and integrity of audit records.

            "discussion": "Penetration testing is a specialized type of assessment conducted on systems or individual system components to identify vulnerabilities that could be exploited by adversaries. Penetration testing goes beyond automated vulnerability scanning and is conducted by agents and teams with demonstrable skills and experience that include technical expertise in network, operating system, and/or application level security. Penetration testing can be used to validate vulnerabilities or determine the degree of penetration resistance of systems to adversaries within specified constraints. Such constraints include time, resources, and skills. Penetration testing attempts to duplicate the actions of adversaries and provides a more in-depth analysis of security- and privacy-related weaknesses or deficiencies. Penetration testing is especially important when organizations are transitioning from older technologies to newer technologies (e.g., transitioning from IPv4 to IPv6 network protocols). Organizations can use the results of vulnerability analyses to support penetration testing activities. Penetration testing can be conducted internally or externally on the hardware, software, or firmware components of a system and can exercise both physical and technical controls. A standard method for penetration testing includes a pretest analysis based on full knowledge of the system, pretest identification of potential vulnerabilities based on the pretest analysis, and testing designed to determine the exploitability of vulnerabilities. All parties agree to the rules of engagement before commencing penetration testing scenarios. Organizations correlate the rules of engagement for the penetration tests with the tools, techniques, and procedures that are anticipated to be employed by adversaries. Penetration testing may result in the exposure of information that is protected by laws or regulations, to individuals conducting the testing. Rules of engagement, contracts, or other appropriate mechanisms can be used to communicate expectations for how to protect this information. Risk assessments guide the decisions on the level of independence required for the personnel conducting penetration testing."

EBS can be used as a hard drive that’s mounted on an EC2 instance (virtual machine). EBS can store data as a standalone apart from EC2. This means that data can persist to the block storage service while an EC2 instance is offline. Out of the box EBS functions as an unformatted file system that needs to be configured and mounted on top of an EC2 instance. EBS can be used as both a storage and boot drive; for the purposes of this document, we will focus on EBS as a storage device. EBS comes with many different options to fit the specific needs of an application. EBS is most likely the right choice if you need quick access to read and write files to the cloud and you need these files to be stored long term. You can also rapidly unmount the file system from one EC2 instance and deploy it to another instance by using snapshots.",

Snapshots are crucial for data recovery, creating new EBS volumes, and replicating data across AWS regions for disaster recovery and high availability.

Impact: Not utilizing EBS snapshots can lead to significant risks and drawbacks. Without snapshots, data recovery becomes more complex and time-consuming, increasing the risk of prolonged downtime in the event of data loss or system failure. Additionally, the absence of incremental backups can lead to higher storage costs and inefficient use of resources.

AWS File Cache is a serverless service on AWS that spares the administrators from the burden of managing file servers and storage volumes, updating hardware, configuring software, running out of capacity, or tuning performance. AWS Elastic cache is capable of handling hundreds of GB/s of throughput and up to millions of operations per second. AWS FSx is an excellent service for cost optimization and high scalability. Amazon File Cache automatically loads data into the cache when it’s accessed for the first time and automatically releases data when it’s not used.",

Any applications and tools that still use the original access key will stop working at this point because they no longer have access to AWS resources.

Additionally, if credentials are encoded into compiled applications or other hard-to- change mechanisms, they are even less likely to be properly rotated due to the risks of service disruption.

If a security group is not specified when an instance is launched, it is automatically assigned to this default security group. Security groups provide stateful filtering of ingress/egress network traffic to AWS resources. It is recommended that the default security group restrict all traffic, both inbound and outbound. The default VPC in every region should have its default security group updated to comply with the following: • No inbound rules. • No outbound rules. Any newly created VPCs will automatically contain a default security group that will need remediation to comply with this recommendation. Note: When implementing this recommendation, VPC flow logging is invaluable in determining the least privilege port access required by systems to work properly, as it can log all packet acceptances and rejections occurring under the current security groups. This dramatically reduces the primary barrier to least privilege engineering by discovering the minimum ports required by systems in the environment. Even if the VPC flow logging recommendation in this benchmark is not adopted as a permanent security measure, it should be used during any period of discovery and engineering for least privileged security groups.",
      "rationale": "Configuring all VPC default security groups to restrict all traffic will encourage the development of least privilege security groups and promote the mindful placement of AWS resources into security groups, which will, in turn, reduce the exposure of those resources. Impact: Implementing this recommendation in an existing VPC that contains operating resources requires extremely careful migration planning, as the default security groups are likely enabling many ports that are unknown. Enabling VPC flow logging (for accepted connections) in an existing environment that is known to be breach-free will reveal the current pattern of ports being used for each instance to communicate successfully.

      "title": "Cluster Access Manager API to streamline and enhance the management of access controls within EKS clusters",
      "description": "Amazon EKS has introduced the Cluster Access Manager API to streamline and enhance the management of access controls within EKS clusters. This new approach is now the recommended method over the traditional aws-auth ConfigMap for managing Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) and Service Accounts. Key Advantages of Using the Cluster Access Manager API: 1. Simplified Access Management: The Cluster Access Manager API allows administrators to manage access directly through the Amazon EKS API, eliminating the need to modify the aws-auth ConfigMap manually. This reduces operational overhead and minimizes the risk of misconfigurations. 2. Enhanced Security Controls: With this API, administrators can assign predefined AWS-managed Kubernetes permissions, known as \"access policies,\" to IAM principals. This provides a more secure and auditable way to manage permissions compared to manual ConfigMap edits. 3. Improved Visibility and Auditing: The API offers better visibility into cluster access configurations, facilitating easier auditing and compliance checks. Administrators can list and describe access entries and policies directly through the EKS API.",
      "rationale": "The compelling rationale for using the Cluster Access Manager API instead of the traditional aws-auth ConfigMap in Amazon EKS revolves around security, scalability, operational efficiency, and simplified management. 1. Increased Security and Reduced Risk • Direct Management via API: The Cluster Access Manager API enables you to manage RBAC and IAM permissions directly through the EKS API rather than editing a ConfigMap. This eliminates the risk of inadvertent errors when manually modifying the aws-auth ConfigMap. • Immutable Access Entries: The API ensures that once access entries are defined, they are tightly controlled, reducing the risk of accidental overwrites or misconfigurations that can happen when editing YAML files. • Fine-Grained Access Control: By leveraging the new API, you can define access policies at a more granular level than the previous method. This ensures that only the necessary permissions are granted, minimizing the attack surface. 2. Operational Efficiency and Scalability • Scalability: Managing access control through the aws-auth ConfigMap becomes increasingly challenging as the number of users and services grows. The new API scales better by allowing access management through standard AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) tools. • Reduced Operational Overhead: The API simplifies the management of access controls by removing the need for manual updates to the ConfigMap, reducing the risk of human error, and automating access provisioning through Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tools like Terraform or CloudFormation. 3. Improved Visibility, Auditing, and Compliance • Auditable and Traceable Changes: The Cluster Access Manager API integrates with AWS CloudTrail, allowing you to track who made changes to access configurations. This level of visibility is critical for organizations that need to adhere to compliance frameworks like SOC 2, GDPR, or HIPAA. • Centralized Management: Unlike the aws-auth ConfigMap, which is managed at the Kubernetes level, the new API leverages AWS IAM’s centralized management and auditing capabilities, providing a unified view of access controls across your AWS environment. 4. Faster and Safer Access Provisioning • No More Cluster Downtime: Errors in the aws-auth ConfigMap can accidentally lock out users or admins from the cluster, requiring complex recovery processes. The API-based approach is more resilient, reducing the risk of misconfigurations causing downtime. • Immediate Effect: Changes made via the API take effect immediately, whereas updates to the aws-auth ConfigMap may require a delay or even restarting components in some cases. 5. Future-Proofing and Alignment with AWS Best Practices • Native Support in Kubernetes Versions: Starting from Kubernetes 1.23, the Cluster Access Manager API is fully supported and designed to replace the aws- auth ConfigMap method. This aligns with AWS’s roadmap and best practices for EKS, ensuring your infrastructure remains compatible with future updates. • Modern Approach for Pod Identity: When combined with IAM Roles for Service Accounts (IRSA) or the new Pod Identity feature, the API supports a more dynamic and secure model for assigning permissions to pods, making it easier to implement least-privilege access. Impact: The shift to using the Cluster Access Manager API instead of the aws-auth ConfigMap impacts EKS RBAC and Service Accounts by simplifying access control management, reducing the risk of misconfigurations, and enhancing security.

The only requirement is to enable the encryption provider support during EKS cluster creation. Use AWS Key Management Service (KMS) keys to provide envelope encryption of Kubernetes secrets stored in Amazon EKS. Implementing envelope encryption is considered a security best practice for applications that store sensitive data and is part of a defense in depth security strategy. Application-layer Secrets Encryption provides an additional layer of security for sensitive data, such as user defined Secrets and Secrets required for the operation of the cluster, such as service account keys, which are all stored in etcd.

Kubernetes Engine uses both Transport Layer Security (TLS) and authentication to provide secure access to your cluster's control plane from the public internet. This provides you the flexibility to administer your cluster from anywhere; however, you might want to further restrict access to a set of IP addresses that you control. You can set this restriction by specifying an authorized network. Restricting access to an authorized network can provide additional security benefits for your container cluster, including: • Better protection from outsider attacks: Authorized networks provide an additional layer of security by limiting external access to a specific set of addresses you designate, such as those that originate from your premises. This helps protect access to your cluster in the case of a vulnerability in the cluster's authentication or authorization mechanism. • Better protection from insider attacks: Authorized networks help protect your cluster from accidental leaks of master certificates from your company's premises. Leaked certificates used from outside Cloud Services and outside the authorized IP ranges (for example, from addresses outside your company) are still denied access. Impact: When implementing Endpoint Private Access, be careful to ensure all desired networks are on the allowlist (whitelist) to prevent inadvertently blocking external access to your cluster's control plane.",

Although Kubernetes API requires an authorized token to perform sensitive actions, a vulnerability could potentially expose the Kubernetes publicly with unrestricted access. Additionally, an attacker may be able to identify the current cluster and Kubernetes API version and determine whether it is vulnerable to an attack. Unless required, disabling public endpoint will help prevent such threats, and require the attacker to be on the master's VPC network to perform any attack on the Kubernetes API. Impact: Configure the EKS cluster endpoint to be private. 1. Leave the cluster endpoint public and specify which CIDR blocks can communicate with the cluster endpoint. The blocks are effectively a whitelisted set of public IP addresses that are allowed to access the cluster endpoint. 2. Configure public access with a set of whitelisted CIDR blocks and set private endpoint access to enabled.

The policy option can't be changed after the cluster is created: Calico Network Policies, an open-source network and network security solution founded by Tigera. Both implementations use Linux iptables to enforce the specified policies. Policies are translated into sets of allowed and disallowed IP pairs. These pairs are then programmed as IPTable filter rules.",
      "rationale": "By default, all pod to pod traffic within a cluster is allowed. Network Policy creates a pod-level firewall that can be used to restrict traffic between sources. Pod traffic is restricted by having a Network Policy that selects it (through the use of labels). Once there is any Network Policy in a namespace selecting a particular pod, that pod will reject any connections that are not allowed by any Network Policy. Other pods in the namespace that are not selected by any Network Policy will continue to accept all traffic. Network Policies are managed via the Kubernetes Network Policy API and enforced by a network plugin, simply creating the resource without a compatible network plugin to implement it will have no effect. Impact: Network Policy requires the Network Policy add-on. This add-on is included automatically when a cluster with Network Policy is created, but for an existing cluster, needs to be added prior to enabling Network Policy. Enabling/Disabling Network Policy causes a rolling update of all cluster nodes, similar to performing a cluster upgrade. This operation is long-running and will block other operations on the cluster (including delete) until it has run to completion. Enabling Network Policy enforcement consumes additional resources in nodes. Specifically, it increases the memory footprint of the kube-system process by approximately 128MB, and requires approximately 300 millicores of CPU.",

        "discussion": "Penetration testing is a specialized type of assessment conducted on systems or individual system components to identify vulnerabilities that could be exploited by adversaries. Penetration testing goes beyond automated vulnerability scanning and is conducted by agents and teams with demonstrable skills and experience that include technical expertise in network, operating system, and/or application level security. Penetration testing can be used to validate vulnerabilities or determine the degree of penetration resistance of systems to adversaries within specified constraints. Such constraints include time, resources, and skills. Penetration testing attempts to duplicate the actions of adversaries and provides a more in-depth analysis of security- and privacy-related weaknesses or deficiencies. Penetration testing is especially important when organizations are transitioning from older technologies to newer technologies (e.g., transitioning from IPv4 to IPv6 network protocols). Organizations can use the results of vulnerability analyses to support penetration testing activities. Penetration testing can be conducted internally or externally on the hardware, software, or firmware components of a system and can exercise both physical and technical controls. A standard method for penetration testing includes a pretest analysis based on full knowledge of the system, pretest identification of potential vulnerabilities based on the pretest analysis, and testing designed to determine the exploitability of vulnerabilities. All parties agree to the rules of engagement before commencing penetration testing scenarios. Organizations correlate the rules of engagement for the penetration tests with the tools, techniques, and procedures that are anticipated to be employed by adversaries. Penetration testing may result in the exposure of information that is protected by laws or regulations, to individuals conducting the testing. Rules of engagement, contracts, or other appropriate mechanisms can be used to communicate expectations for how to protect this information. Risk assessments guide the decisions on the level of independence required for the personnel conducting penetration testing."

EBS can be used as a hard drive that’s mounted on an EC2 instance (virtual machine). EBS can store data as a standalone apart from EC2. This means that data can persist to the block storage service while an EC2 instance is offline. Out of the box EBS functions as an unformatted file system that needs to be configured and mounted on top of an EC2 instance. EBS can be used as both a storage and boot drive; for the purposes of this document, we will focus on EBS as a storage device. EBS comes with many different options to fit the specific needs of an application. EBS is most likely the right choice if you need quick access to read and write files to the cloud and you need these files to be stored long term. You can also rapidly unmount the file system from one EC2 instance and deploy it to another instance by using snapshots.",

AWS File Cache is a serverless service on AWS that spares the administrators from the burden of managing file servers and storage volumes, updating hardware, configuring software, running out of capacity, or tuning performance. AWS Elastic cache is capable of handling hundreds of GB/s of throughput and up to millions of operations per second. AWS FSx is an excellent service for cost optimization and high scalability. Amazon File Cache automatically loads data into the cache when it’s accessed for the first time and automatically releases data when it’s not used.",
