    "description": "IIS supports both challenge-based and login redirection-based authentication methods. Challenge-based authentication methods, such as Integrated Windows Authentication, require a client to respond correctly to a server-initiated challenge. A login redirection- based authentication method such as Forms Authentication relies on redirection to a login page to determine the identity of the principal. Challenge-based authentication and login redirection-based authentication methods cannot be used in conjunction with one another. Public servers/sites are typically configured to use Anonymous Authentication. This method typically works, provided the content or services is intended for use by the public. When sites, applications, or specific content containers are not intended for anonymous public use, an appropriate authentication mechanism should be utilized. Authentication will help confirm the identity of clients who request access to sites, application, and content. IIS provides the following authentication modules by default: • Anonymous Authentication - allows anonymous users to access sites, applications, and/or content • Integrated Windows Authentication - authenticates users using the NTLM or Kerberos protocols; Kerberos v5 requires a connection to Active Directory • ASP.NET Impersonation - allows ASP.NET applications to run under a security context different from the default security context for an application • Forms Authentication - enables a user to login to the configured space with a valid user name and password which is then validated against a database or other credentials store • Basic authentication - requires a valid user name and password to access content • Client Certificate Mapping Authentication - allows automatic authentication of users who log on with client certificates that have been configured; requires SSL • Digest Authentication - uses Windows domain controller to authenticate users who request access Note that none of the challenge-based authentication modules can be used at the same time Forms Authentication is enabled for certain applications/content. Forms Authentication  26 | P a g e does not rely on IIS authentication, so anonymous access for the ASP.NET application can be configured if Forms Authentication will be used.

The cookie is passed in a HTTP header together with all requests between the client and server. Session information can also be stored in the URL.  However, storing session information in this manner has security implications that can open attack vectors such as session hijacking.  An effective method used to prevent session hijacking attacks is to force web applications to use cookies to store the session token.

Clients send a cipher list and a list of ciphers that it supports in order of preference to a server. The server then replies with the cipher suite that it selects from the client cipher suite list.",
