For more information on setting up DMARC for Google Workspace please refer to the Google documentation. \u2022 Help prevent spoofing and spam with DMARC \u2022 Tutorial: Recommended DMARC rollout",
    "rationale": "DMARC works with Sender Policy Framework (SPF) and Domain Keys Identified Mail (DKIM) to authenticate mail senders and ensure that destination email systems trust messages sent from your domain. Spammers can spoof your domain or organization to send fake messages that impersonate your organization. DMARC tells receiving mail servers what to do when they get a message that appears to be from your organization, but doesn't pass authentication checks, or doesn\u2019t meet the authentication requirements in your DMARC policy record. Messages that aren't authenticated might be impersonating your organization, or might be sent from unauthorized servers.

This is a relaxed DMARC policy that lets you start getting reports without risking messages from your domain being rejected or marked as spam by receiving servers. Start with a none policy that only monitors email flow, and then eventually change to a policy that rejects all unauthenticated messages (p=reject). NOTE: The rua=mailto:_report@domain1.com entry is optional but setting it to a valid email address is recommended. RUA reports provide a comprehensive view of all of a domain\u2019s traffic.

The Advanced Protection Program includes a curated group of high-security policies that are applied to enrolled accounts. Additional policies may be added to the Advanced Protection Program to ensure the protections are current. Advanced Protection allows you to apply all of these protections at once, and override similar settings you may have configured manually. These policies include: \u2022 Strong authentication with security keys \u2022 Use of security codes with security keys (as needed) \u2022 Restrictions on third-party access to account data \u2022 Deep Gmail scans \u2022 Google Safe Browsing protections in Chrome (when users are signed into Chrome using the same identity as their Advanced Protection Program identity) \u2022 Account recovery through admin Impact: User Impact \u2022 You need your security key when you sign in for the first time on a computer, browser, or device.

For example, for users that work remotely or from untrusted locations, you might want to limit the time that they can access sensitive resources by applying a shorter web session length. If users want to continue accessing a resource when a session ends, they\u2019re prompted to sign in again and start a new session. How the settings work on mobile devices varies by device and app. Impact: The potential impact associated with implementation of this setting are: \u2022 When a web session expires for a user, they see the Verify it's you page and must sign in again. \u2022 When you change the session length, users need to sign out and in again for settings to take effect. \u2022 If you set the session to never expire, users never have to sign in again. \u2022 If you need some users to sign in more frequently than others, place them in different organizational units.

A note on the Investigation tool The Investigation tool found in the Security center portion of the Google Workspace Admin UI is a powerful tool for investigating various incidents. It is basically a flexible search that has access to essentially all the various logs in Google Workspace. How this tool would be used is very organization-specific and possibly event specific, so CIS does not have any specific recommendations for its use in this Benchmark. That being said, admins should be aware of this tool and it capabilities, since it will be very useful in detecting and resolving various incidents, so we urge admins to get familiar with the tool. For example, you can use the investigation tool to: \u2022 Access data about devices. \u2022 Access device log data to get a clear view of the devices and applications being used to access your data. \u2022 Access data about Gmail messages, including email content. \u2022 Access Gmail log data to find and erase malicious emails, mark emails as spam or phishing, or send emails to users\u2019 inboxes. \u2022 View search results that list suspended users. \u2022 Access Drive log data to investigate file sharing in your organization, investigate the creation and deletion of documents, investigate who accessed documents, and more.
