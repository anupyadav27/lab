Choose \"Assign Resources\" and provide a name for the assignment. For now, maintain the role as Default.

While inside the resource you want to configure an access point for, type in this command: mount -t efs -o tls,iam,accesspoint=fsap-abcdef0123456789a fs- abc0123def456789a: /localmountpoint  3. Enforcing a User Identity with an EFS access point: You can enforce user identity to ensure that users and groups with proper permissions are able to access the EFS file system. In order to do this, you must specify the user and group ID you wish to have ownership of the files. When enforcement is enabled, that file that is was created by the user will automatically show ownership to belong to the user. When enforcement is enabled, the access point considers the User ID, group ID, and secondary group ID. It ignored the NFS client's ID. Note: enforcing the user ID is subject to the cClientRootAccess IAM permission. If either the User ID or Group ID = 0, then you must explicitly allow cClientRootAccess permission.  4. Enforcing a root directory with an access point: If you wish to override the root directory of the EFS, you can make the root directory that of the access point. To enforce the root directory with an access point, you must specify three things upon provisioning the EFS mount point: o Owner UID o Group GID o Permissions To access an EFS from an access point, a root directory must be created and enforced. Reminder: You must specify permissions for the access point root directory. If these permissions are not defined, a root directory will not be created on the mount point, and you will not be able to access EFS from an access point. 5.

Amazon File Cache automatically loads data into the cache when it's accessed for the first time and automatically releases data when it's not used.",
    "rationale": "Amazon File Cache is used as a temporary, high performance storage location for data that's stored in on-premises file systems, AWS file systems, and Amazon S3 buckets. This service is used for data processing and is best suited for applications that need high data processing speeds. This is not a long term storage option.",
    "audit": "",
    "remediation": "You can link your cache to S3 data repositories or to any file system that supports the NFSv3 protocol. The NFS data repository can either be on premises or in the cloud and you can link a maximum of eight repositories. All the linked repositories must be using the same file system; either S3 or NFS. When linked to a data repository, Amazon File Cache transparently presents S3 or NFS objects as files and directories. Amazon File Cache is compatible to be used interchangeably with Amazon Elastic Compute Service, Amazon Elastic Container Service, and Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service.

Attach the ISO to your original server and boot up the server. o The failback client will prompt for the IAM access key and secret key generated when making the user with the permission to access the failback. It will also ask for the region of the recovery instance. Remember: regions are case sensitive. If you're in US east 1, type us-east-1. o If you are failing back to the original server, the failback client will automatically detect the recovery instance and map the data volumes for replication. o If you are failing back to a new server, you may need to manually specify from a list of available recovery instances and map the data volumes. o The failback client will verify that the chosen recovery instance has connectivity to the Elastic Disaster Recovery service. o The replication software will be downloaded to the failback client and then configured. Connectivity will be made between the failback client and the replication agent on the recovery instance to begin data replication. 3. Return to the elastic disaster recovery console and recovery instances to see the current state of replication. Failing back to the original server will show crescan in the console, while failing back o a new instance will perform an cinitial sync. 4. After the data replication is completed, you will be able to perform the failback. o Check the state of the recovery instance to ensure that it's ready to complete a failback. o Select your recovery instance, then choose failback for the chosen recovery instance(s). o Choose failback again the complete a failback for the chosen recovery instance(s). During the failback process, the failback client will prepare your source server for normal operation. After it has completed successfully, the failback client will return cfailback completed successfully in the console. 5. Reboot the server and return to normal operations. 6.

    "audit": "1. Preparing the Environment for EDR - Before getting started with EDR, you must prepare the environment that you want to back up. 2. Preparing the Source Server - Allow direct access to Elastic Disaster Recovery and Amazon S3 AWS service API endpoints through HTTPS protocol (TCP port 443). Direct outbound TCP port 1500 from the source server to the staging area subnet, which contains the replication servers. 3. Preparing the Staging Area Subnet - Allow Direct access to EDR, S3, and EC2 through HTTPS protocol (TCP port 443) Direct inbound TCP port 1500 for replication traffic 4. Accessing the AWS Elastic Disaster Recovery Console - o Search for cAWS Elastic Disaster Recoveryc in the AWS Console. o Select cElastic Disaster Recoveryc 5. Configuring the Replication Settings Template - Select Configure and Initializein in the AWS Elastic Disaster Recovery screen. You will be navigated to setup your replication settings template. This will create a staging area in a subnet of your choice and a replication server instance types. The default replication server instance type will be a t3 micro EC2 instance. This is good for normal workloads with small I/O operations. 6. Next, configure EBS encryption and volume types. This will depend on your workload requirements. 7. To encrypt EBS volumes, leave the setting as cdefault.c If you wish to make a custom encryption setting, you will need to create an AWS KMS key. 8. Configure the security group to your specific needs. Remember what ports need to be opened on inbound / outbound traffic that was specified in previous steps: You can choose how you want your data routed and if you want to throttle network traffic to reserve bandwidth. To keep your data as secure as possible, it's recommended to get set up with a VPN or AWS direct connect, so your backups are not traveling over the public internet. Point in time policy defines the snapshot retention time. Because Elastic Disaster Recovery service uses incremental backups, it's not necessary to keep old copies of backups. Now, you're ready to launch this template.",
