Zoning defines which host bus adapters (HBAs) can connect to which targets. The devices outside a zone are not visible to the devices inside the zone when SAN zoning is configured. For example, zones defined for testing should be managed independently within the SAN so they do not interfere with activity in the production zones. Similarly, you can set up different zones for different departments. Zoning must take into account any host groups that have been set up on the SAN device. LUN masking is a process that makes a LUN available to some hosts and unavailable to other hosts.",

    "title": "(L1) Ensure VM log file size is limited",
    "assessment": "Automated",
    "description": "Normally a new log file is created only when a host is rebooted, so the file can grow to be quite large. You can ensure that new log files are created more frequently by limiting the maximum size of the log files. If you want to restrict the total size of logging data, VMware recommends saving 10 log files, each one limited to 1 MB. If the maximum number of log files already exists, when a new one is created, the oldest log file is deleted.",
    "rationale": "Virtual machine users and processes can abuse logging either on purpose or inadvertently so that large amounts of data flood the log file. Without restrictions on maximum log file size, over time a log file can consume enough file system space to cause a denial of service. Impact: A more extreme strategy is to disable logging altogether for the virtual machine. Disabling logging makes troubleshooting challenging and support difficult. Do not consider disabling logging unless the log file rotation approach proves insufficient.",
    "audit": "To verify the maximum log file size is limited properly, verify that log.rotateSize is set to 1024000. 1. Select the VM then select Actions followed by Edit Settings. 2. Click on the VM Options tab then expand Advanced. 3. Click on EDIT CONFIGURATION. 4. Verify that log.rotateSize is set to 1024000. Alternately, the following PowerCLI command may be used: # List the VMs and their current settings Get-VM | Get-AdvancedSetting -Name  \"log.rotateSize\"| Select Entity, Name, Value",
    "remediation": "To set this configuration utilize the vSphere interface as follows: 1. Select the VM then select Actions followed by Edit Settings. 2. Click on the VM Options tab then expand Advanced. 3. Click on EDIT CONFIGURATION. 4. Click on ADD CONFIGURATION PARAMS then input log.rotateSize with a value of 1024000. 5. Click OK, then OK again.
