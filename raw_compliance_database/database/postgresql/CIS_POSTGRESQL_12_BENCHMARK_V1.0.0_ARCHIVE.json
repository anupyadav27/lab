If you specify a filename without escapes, you should plan to use a log rotation utility to avoid eventually filling the partition that contains log_directory. If there are any time-zone-dependent %-escapes, the computation is done in the zone specified by log_timezone. Also, the system's strftime is not used directly, so platform- specific (nonstandard) extensions do not work.

    "description": "In addition to the SQL-standard privilege system available through GRANT, tables can have row security policies that restrict, on a per-user basis, which individual rows can be returned by normal queries or inserted, updated, or deleted by data modification commands. This feature is also known as Row Level Security (RLS). By default, tables do not have any policies, so if a user has access privileges to a table according to the SQL privilege system, all rows within it are equally available for querying or updating. Row security policies can be specific to commands, to roles, or to both. A policy can be specified to apply to ALL commands, or to any combination of SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE. Multiple roles can be assigned to a given policy, and normal role membership and inheritance rules apply. If you use RLS and apply restrictive policies to certain users, it is important that the Bypass RLS privilege not be granted to any unauthorized users. This privilege overrides RLS- enabled tables and associated policies. Generally, only superusers and elevated users should possess this privilege.",

As of PostgreSQL 9.5, the catalog table pg_class provides column relrowsecurity to query and determine whether a relation has RLS enabled. Based on results below we can see RLS is not enabled. Assuming this table should be RLS enabled but is not, this is a finding. postgres=# SELECT oid, relname, relrowsecurity FROM pg_class WHERE relname = 'passwd'; oid  | relname | relrowsecurity -------+---------+---------------- 24679 | passwd  | f (1 row) Further inspection of RLS policies are provided via the system catalog pg_policy, which records policy details including table OID, policy name, applicable commands, the roles assigned a policy, and the USING and WITH CHECK clauses. Finally, RLS and associated policies (if implemented) may also be viewed using the standard psql display command \\d+ schema.table which lists RLS information as part of the table description. Should you implement Row Level Security and apply restrictive policies to certain users, it's imperative that you check each user's role definition via the psql display command \\du and ensure unauthorized users have not been granted Bypass RLS privilege as this would override any RLS enabled tables and associated policies.

This is controlled by the configuration parameter password_encryption at the time the password is set. If a password was encrypted using the scram-sha-256 setting, then it can be used for the authentication methods scram-sha-256 and password (but password transmission will be in plain text in the latter case). The authentication method specification md5 will automatically switch to using the scram-sha-256 method in this case, as explained above, so it will also work. If a password was encrypted using the md5 setting, then it can be used only for the md5 and password authentication method specifications (again, with the password transmitted in plain text in the latter case). Previous PostgreSQL releases supported storing the password on the server in plain text. This is no longer possible. To check the currently stored password hashes, see the system catalog pg_authid. To upgrade an existing installation from md5 to scram-sha-256, after having ensured that all client libraries in use are new enough to support SCRAM, set password_encryption = 'scram-sha-256' in postgresql.conf, reload the postmaster, make all users set new passwords, and change the authentication method specifications in pg_hba.conf to scram- sha-256.

These cryptographic mechanisms may be native to PostgreSQL or implemented via additional software or operating system/file system settings, as appropriate to the situation. Information at rest refers to the state of information when it is located on a secondary storage device (e.g. disk drive, tape drive) within an organizational information system. Selection of a cryptographic mechanism is based on the need to protect the integrity of organizational information. The strength of the mechanism is commensurate with the security category and/or classification of the information. Organizations have the flexibility to either encrypt all information on storage devices (i.e. full disk encryption) or encrypt specific data structures (e.g. files, records, or fields). Organizations may also optionally choose to implement both to implement layered security. The decision whether, and what, to encrypt rests with the data owner and is also influenced by the physical measures taken to secure the equipment and media on which the information resides. Organizations may choose to employ different mechanisms to achieve confidentiality and integrity protections, as appropriate.

Once installed, pgBackRest must be configured for things like stanza name, backup location, retention policy, logging, etc. Please consult the configuration guide. If employing pgBackRest for your backup/recovery solution, ensure the repository, base backups, and WAL archives are stored on a reliable file system separate from the database server. Further, the external storage system where backups resided should have limited access to only those system administrators as necessary. Finally, as with any backup/recovery solution, stringent testing must be conducted.

    "description": "This recommendation covers non-regular, special files, and dynamic libraries. PostgreSQL permits local logins via the UNIX DOMAIN SOCKET and, for the most part, anyone with a legitimate Unix login account can make the attempt. Limiting PostgreSQL login attempts can be made by relocating the UNIX DOMAIN SOCKET to a subdirectory with restricted permissions. The creation and implementation of user-defined dynamic libraries is an extraordinary powerful capability. In the hands of an experienced DBA/programmer, it can significantly enhance the power and flexibility of the RDBMS. But new and unexpected behavior can also be assigned to the RDBMS, resulting in a very dangerous environment in what should otherwise be trusted.",

Alternatively, inspect the parameter settings in the postgresql.conf configuration file. postgres=# select name, setting from pg_settings where name in ('external_pid_file', 'unix_socket_directories','shared_preload_libraries','dynamic_library_path',' local_preload_libraries','session_preload_libraries'); name            |          setting ---------------------------+--------------------------- dynamic_library_path      | $libdir external_pid_file         | local_preload_libraries   | session_preload_libraries | shared_preload_libraries  | pgaudit, set_user unix_socket_directories   | /var/run/postgresql, /tmp (6 rows) Inspect the file and directory permissions for all returned values. Only superusers should have access control rights for these files and directories. If permissions are not highly restricted, this is a fail.  161 | P a g e",
    "remediation": "Follow these steps to remediate the configuration: • Determine permissions based on your organization's security policies. • Relocate all files and ensure their permissions are restricted as much as possible, i.e. only superuser read access. • Ensure all directories where these files are located have restricted permissions such that the superuser can read but not write. • Lastly, change the settings accordingly in the postgresql.conf configuration file and restart the database cluster for changes to take effect. Default Value: The dynamic_library_path default is $libdir and unix_socket_directories default is /var/run/postgresql, /tmp. The default for external_pid_file and all library parameters are initially null, or not set, upon cluster creation.
