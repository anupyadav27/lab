If a system intended to protect sensitive data lacks the proper FIPS 140-2 certificate, Federal agencies cannot purchase it. Products such as OpenSSL can be used in FIPS mode, although the OpenSSL library itself is not validated for FIPS. Instead, the OpenSSL library is used with the OpenSSL FIPS Object Module to enable OpenSSL-based applications to operate in FIPS mode. For general information about FIPS and its implementation in OpenSSL, these references may be helpful: \u2022 National Institute of Standards and Technology FIPS PUB 140-2 \u2022 OpenSSL FIPS 140-2 Security Policy \u2022 fips_module manual page",

Currently OpenSSL 3.0 is certified, but OpenSSL 1.1.1 is not. Binary distributions for recent versions of MySQL are compiled using OpenSSL 3.0 on some platforms, which means they are not certified for FIPS. This means you have the following options, depending on system and MySQL configuration: o Use a system that has OpenSSL 3.0 and the required FIPS object module. In this case, you can enable FIPS mode for MySQL if you use a binary distribution compiled using OpenSSL 3.0, or compile MySQL from source using OpenSSL 3.0. For general information about upgrading to OpenSSL 3.0, see OpenSSL 3.0 Migration Guide o Use a system that has OpenSSL 1.1.1 or higher. In this case, you can install MySQL using binary packages, and you can use the TLS v1.3 protocol and ciphersuites, in addition to other already supported TLS protocols. However, you cannot enable FIPS mode for MySQL. o Use a system that has OpenSSL 1.0.2 and the required FIPS Object Module. In this case, you can enable FIPS mode for MySQL if you use a binary distribution compiled using OpenSSL 1.0.2, or compile MySQL from source using OpenSSL 1.0.2. In this case, you cannot use the TLS v1.3 protocol or ciphersuites, which require OpenSSL 1.1.1 or 3.0. In addition, you should be aware that OpenSSL 1.0.2 reached end of life status in 2019, and that all operating platforms embedding OpenSSL 1.1.1 reach their end of life in 2024. 2. At runtime, the OpenSSL library and OpenSSL FIPS Object Module must be available as shared (dynamically linked) objects. If FIPS mode is required, it is recommended to use an operating platforms that includes it; if it does, you can (and should) use it. If your platform does not include FIPS, you have two options: \u2022 Migrate to a platform which has FIPS OpenSSL support. \u2022 Build the OpenSSL library and FIPS object module from source, using the instructions from the fips_module manpage see FIPS Overview. To determine whether MySQL is running on a system with FIPS mode enabled, check the value of the ssl_fips_mode server system variable using an SQL statement such as SHOW VARIABLES LIKE '%fips%' or SELECT @@ssl_fips_mode If the value of this variable is 1 (ON) or 2 (STRICT), FIPS mode is enabled for OpenSSL; if it is 0 (OFF), FIPS mode is not available. Additionally you can also check the Operating system to see that FIPS mode is enabled. For example on Oracle Linux 9 to verify that FIPS mode is enabled, run the following command after Oracle Linux 9 has been installed: As the system administrator: 1. Run the following to see if FIPS is enabled: fips-mode-setup --check If FIPS mode is enabled is not displayed, then the system is not FIPS enabled and this is a fail. 2. Run the following (your results and version may vary): # openssl version OpenSSL 3.0.7 1 Nov 2022 (Library: OpenSSL 3.0.7 1 Nov 2022) OpenSSL should show a 3.0 version.",
