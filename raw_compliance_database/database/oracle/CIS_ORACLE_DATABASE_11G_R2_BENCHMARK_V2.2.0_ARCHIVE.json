Such security measures help to ensure that successful logins cannot be easily redirected. IMPORTANT: Use caution when revoking privileges from PUBLIC. Oracle and third-party products explicitly require default grants to PUBLIC for commonly used functions, objects, and in view definitions. After revoking any privilege from PUBLIC, verify that applications keep running properly. After revoking privileges from PUBLIC, recompile invalid database objects. Specific grants to users and roles may be needed to make all objects valid. Please see the following Oracle support document which provides further information and SQL statements that can be used to determine dependencies that require explicit grants.

Decisions must be made regarding the scope of auditing since auditing has costs - in storage for the audit trail and in performance impact on audited operations - and perhaps even the database or system in general. There is also the additional cost to manage (store, backup, secure) and review the data in audit trail. Measures must be taken to protect the audit trail itself, for it may be targeted for alteration or destruction to hide unauthorized activity. For an audit destination outside the database, the recommendations are elsewhere in this document. Auditing recommendations for potential database audit destinations is below. Auditing \"by session\" typically creates fewer (until 11g) and slightly smaller audit records, but is discouraged in most situations since there is some loss of fidelity (e.g. object privilege GRANTEE). More detailed auditing creates larger audit records. The AUDIT_TRAIL initialization parameter (for DB|XML, extended - or not) is the main determining factor for the size of a given audit record - and a notable factor in the performance cost, although the largest of the latter is DB versus OS or XML. This section deals with standard Oracle auditing since auditing of privileged connections (as sysdba or sysoper) is configured via the AUDIT_SYS_OPERATIONS initialization parameter and is otherwise not configurable. The basic types of standard auditing are object auditing, statement auditing and privilege auditing and each behaves differently. Object auditing applies to specific objects for which it is invoked and always applies to all users. This type of auditing is usually employed to audit application-specific sensitive objects, but can be used to protect the audit trail in the database. Privilege auditing audits the use of specific system privileges, but typically only if the user actually possesses the audited privilege. Attempts that fail for lack of the audited privilege are typically not audited. This is the main weakness of privilege auditing and why statement auditing is usually preferred, if the option exists. Statement auditing audits the issuance of certain types of statements, usually without regard to privilege or lack thereof. Both privilege and statement audits may be specified for specific users or all users (the default).   128 | P a g e",

    "impact": "This is just a clarification.  There is no change the what is actually audited.  The check does now included conditions to insure that this auditing applies regardless of user or proxy and that it must include auditing both success and failure.   154 | P a g e 6 Appendix: Establishing an Audit/Scan User This document has been authored with the expectation that a user with appropriate permissions will be used to execute the queries and perform other assessment actions.  While this could be accomplished by granting DBA privileges to a given user, the preferred approach is to create a dedicated user and granting only the specific permissions required to perform the assessments expressed herein.  Doing this avoids the necessity for any user assessing the system needs to be granted DBA privileges. The recommendations expressed in this document assume the presence of a role named CISSCANROLE and a user named CISSCAN.  This role and user should be created by executing the following SQL statements, being careful to substitute an appropriate password for <password>. -- Create the role CREATE ROLE CISSCANROLE; -- Grant necessary privileges to the role GRANT CREATE SESSION TO CISSCANROLE; GRANT SELECT ON V_$PARAMETER TO CISSCANROLE; GRANT SELECT ON DBA_TAB_PRIVS TO CISSCANROLE; GRANT SELECT ON DBA_PROFILES TO CISSCANROLE; GRANT SELECT ON DBA_SYS_PRIVS TO CISSCANROLE; GRANT SELECT ON DBA_STMT_AUDIT_OPTS TO CISSCANROLE; GRANT SELECT ON DBA_ROLE_PRIVS TO CISSCANROLE; GRANT SELECT ON DBA_OBJ_AUDIT_OPTS TO CISSCANROLE; GRANT SELECT ON DBA_PRIV_AUDIT_OPTS TO CISSCANROLE; GRANT SELECT ON DBA_PROXIES TO CISSCANROLE; GRANT SELECT ON DBA_USERS TO CISSCANROLE; GRANT SELECT ON DBA_USERS_WITH_DEFPWD TO CISSCANROLE; -- Create the user and assign the user to the role CREATE USER CISSCAN IDENTIFIED BY C1ph3r00; GRANT CISSCANROLE TO CISSCAN; If you rely on similar roles and/or users, but which are not named as CISSCANROLE or CISSCAN, or if you have roles or users named CISSCANROLE or CISSCAN intended to be used for different purposes, be aware that some recommendations herein explicitly name CISSCANROLE and CISSCAN.
