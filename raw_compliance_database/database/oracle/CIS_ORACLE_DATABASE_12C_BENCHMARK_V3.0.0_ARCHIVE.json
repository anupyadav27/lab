In statement auditing, PROCEDURE has a larger scope than in privilege auditing, where it is specific to functions, packages and procedures, but excludes libraries and perhaps other object types. Audit PROCEDURE does not audit altering procedures, either in your own schema or in another via the ALTER ANY PROCEDURE system privilege. There seems to be no statement audit that is a better replacement for Audit ALTER ANY PROCEDURE, but beware that will not create any audit records for users that do not have the privilege. Thus, attempts to alter procedures in one's own schema are never audited, and attempts to alter procedures in another's schema that fail for lack of the ALTER ANY PROCEDURE privilege are not audited. This is simply a weakness in the current state of Oracle auditing. Fortunately, though, all that the ALTER command can be used for regarding procedures, functions, packages and libraries is compile options, so the inability to comprehensively audit alter procedure activities and requests is not as bad as it would be for other object types (USER, PROFILE, etc.)",
