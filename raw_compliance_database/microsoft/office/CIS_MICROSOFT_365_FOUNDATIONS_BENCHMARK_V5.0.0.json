Note: Programmatically CIS-CAT will pass when 90% or more of the extensions listed are present in a policy, leaving 10% or approximately 18 extensions for possible exceptions. Organizations should evaluate these both independently and based on business need. Note: The audit procedure intentionally does not include the action taken for matched extensions, e.g. Reject with NDR or Quarantine the message. These are considered organization specific and are not scored. When FileTypeAction is not specified the action will default to Reject the message with a non-delivery receipt (NDR). The Quarantine Policy is also considered organization specific.",

    "assessment": "Automated",
    "description": "Authentication strength is a Conditional Access control that allows administrators to specify which combination of authentication methods can be used to access a resource. For example, they can make only phishing-resistant authentication methods available to access a sensitive resource. But to access a non-sensitive resource, they can allow less secure multifactor authentication (MFA) combinations, such as password + SMS. Microsoft has 3 built-in authentication strengths. MFA strength, Passwordless MFA strength, and Phishing-resistant MFA strength. Ensure administrator roles are using a CA policy with Phishing-resistant MFA strength. Administrators can then enroll using one of 3 methods: \u2022 FIDO2 Security Key \u2022 Windows Hello for Business \u2022 Certificate-based authentication (Multi-Factor) Note: Additional steps to configure methods such as FIDO2 keys are not covered here but can be found in related MS articles in the references section. The Conditional Access policy only ensures 1 of the 3 methods is used. Warning: Administrators should be pre-registered for a strong authentication mechanism before this Conditional Access Policy is enforced. Additionally, as stated elsewhere in the CIS Benchmark a break-glass administrator account should be excluded from this policy to ensure unfettered access in the case of an emergency.",
    "rationale": "Sophisticated attacks targeting MFA are more prevalent as the use of it becomes more widespread. These 3 methods are considered phishing-resistant as they remove passwords from the login workflow. It also ensures that public/private key exchange can only happen between the devices and a registered provider which prevents login to fake or phishing websites.  Impact: If administrators aren't pre-registered for a strong authentication method prior to a conditional access policy being created, then a condition could occur where a user can't register for strong authentication because they don't meet the conditional access policy requirements and therefore are prevented from signing in. Additionally, Internet Explorer based credential prompts in PowerShell do not support prompting for a security key.

    "assessment": "Automated",
    "description": "Conditional Access (CA) can be configured to enforce access based on the device's compliance status or whether it is Entra hybrid joined. Collectively this allows CA to classify devices as managed or unmanaged, providing more granular control over authentication policies. When using Require device to be marked as compliant, the device must pass checks configured in Compliance policies defined within Intune (Endpoint Manager). Before these checks can be applied, the device must first be enrolled in Intune MDM. By selecting Require Microsoft Entra hybrid joined device this means the device must first be synchronized from an on-premises Active Directory to qualify for authentication.

The recommended state is: \u2022 Require device to be marked as compliant \u2022 Require Microsoft Entra hybrid joined device \u2022 Require one of the selected controls",
    "rationale": "\"Managed\" devices are considered more secure because they often have additional configuration hardening enforced through centralized management such as Intune or Group Policy. These devices are also typically equipped with MDR/EDR, managed patching and alerting systems. As a result, they provide a safer environment for users to authenticate and operate from. This policy also ensures that attackers must first gain access to a compliant or trusted device before authentication is permitted, reducing the risk posed by compromised account credentials. When combined with other distinct Conditional Access (CA) policies, such as requiring multi-factor authentication, this adds one additional factor before authentication is permitted. Note: Avoid combining these two settings with other Grant settings in the same policy. In a single policy you can only choose between Require all the selected controls or Require one of the selected controls, which limits the ability to integrate this recommendation with others in this benchmark. CA policies function as an \"AND\" operator across multiple policies. The goal here is to both (Require MFA for all users) AND (Require device to be marked as compliant OR Require Microsoft Entra hybrid joined device).

With this method, users are prompted to confirm a number displayed on their original device and enter it into the device being used for MFA. Additionally, other information such as geolocation and application details are displayed to enhance the end user's awareness. Among these 3 options, number matching provides the strongest net security gain.
