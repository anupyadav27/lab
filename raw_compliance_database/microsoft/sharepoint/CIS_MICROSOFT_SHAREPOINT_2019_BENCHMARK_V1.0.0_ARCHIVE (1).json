Claims-based identity is an identity model in SharePoint that includes features such as authentication across users of Windows-based systems and systems that are not Windows- based, multiple authentication types, stronger real-time authentication, a wider set of principal types, and delegation of user identity between applications. When a user signs in to SharePoint, the user's token is validated and then used to sign in to SharePoint. The user's token is a security token issued by a claims provider. When you build claims-aware applications, the user presents an identity to the application as a set of claims. One claim could be the user's name, another might be an email address. The external identity system is configured to give your application all the information that it needs about the user with each request, along with cryptographic assurance that the identity data received by the application comes from a trusted source.",
