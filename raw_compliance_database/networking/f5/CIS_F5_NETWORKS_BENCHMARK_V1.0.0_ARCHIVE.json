When you enable this setting, the Configuration utility displays the Minimum Length and Required Characters settings.

The default value is 6, and the system allows the range of values from 6 through 255. This setting appears in the Configuration utility, and the system only enforces it when you enable the Secure Password Enforcement setting. -Required Characters Specifies the number of numeric, uppercase, lowercase, and other characters required for a password. The default value for each character type is 0, and the system allows the range of values from 0 through 127. This setting appears in the Configuration utility, and the system only enforces it when you enable the Secure Password Enforcement setting. -Password Memory Specifies, for each user account, the number of former passwords that the BIG-IP system retains to prevent the user from reusing a recent password.

If a user does not change their password by the time they reach the maximum duration, in versions prior to BIG-IP 13.1.0, an administrator must change the user's password, and in BIG-IP 13.1.0 and after, the user can reset their own password. -Expiration Warning Specifies the number of days prior to password expiration that the system sends a warning message to a users.
