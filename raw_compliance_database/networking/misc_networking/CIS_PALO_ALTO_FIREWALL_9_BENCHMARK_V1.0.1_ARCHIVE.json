A MDM (Mobile Device Manager) can be used to accomplish the same task for mobile devices such as telephones or tablets. Other central management or orchestration tools can be used for Linux or \"IoT\" (Internet of Things) devices. 2: Users that are not member of the organization - often these are classed as \"Visitors\" in the policies of the organization. If a public CA Certificate is a possibility for your organization, then that is one approach. A second approach is to not decrypt affected traffic - this is easily done, but leaves the majority of \"visitor\" traffic uninspected and potentially carrying malicious content.
