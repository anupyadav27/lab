    "rationale": "App-ID requires a number of packets to traverse the firewall before an application can be identified and either allowed or dropped. Due to this behavior, even when an application is defined in a security policy, a service setting of any may allow a device in one zone to perform ports scans on IP addresses in a different zone. In addition, this recommendation helps to avoid an App-ID cache pollution attack. Because of how App-ID works, configuring the service Setting to \"Any\" allows some initial traffic to reach the target host before App-ID can recognize and appropriately restrict the traffic. Setting the Service Setting to application specific at least restricts the traffic to the target applications or protocols for that initial volume of traffic.",

    "rationale": "In incident response, logging denied traffic is often just as important as logging permitted traffic. The logs for denied traffic can be used to establish a pattern of failed attack attempts before the final attack succeeds. This can be used in attribution and identification of the attacker, but can also be used to help identify which defenses need shoring up to defend against future attacks. Viewing denied traffic can also be useful for understanding how security policies are affecting traffic. Palo Alto firewalls do not log denied traffic by default. Therefore, to acquire visibility to denied traffic, a “deny and log” policy must be created at the end of the security policy ruleset.",

    "description": "The CA Certificate used for in-line HTTP Man in the Middle should be trusted by target users. There are two classes of users that need to be considered. 1: Users that are members of the organization, users of machines under control of the organization. For these people and machines, ensure that the CA Certificate is in one of the Trusted CA certificate stores. This is easily done in Active Directory, using Group Policies for instance. A MDM (Mobile Device Manager) can be used to accomplish the same task for mobile devices such as telephones or tablets. Other central management or orchestration tools can be used for Linux or \"IoT\" (Internet of Things) devices. 2: Users that are not member of the organization - often these are classed as \"Visitors\" in the policies of the organization. If a public CA Certificate is a possibility for your organization, then that is one approach. A second approach is to not decrypt affected traffic - this is easily done, but leaves the majority of \"visitor\" traffic uninspected and potentially carrying malicious content. The final approach, and the one most commonly seen, is to use the same certificate as is used for members organization. In this last case, visitors will see a certificate warning, but the issuing CA will be the organization that they are visiting.",
    "rationale": "Using a self-signed certificate, or any certificate that generates a warning in the browser, means that members of the organization have no method of determining if they are being presented with a legitimate certificate, or an attacker's \"man in the middle' certificate.
