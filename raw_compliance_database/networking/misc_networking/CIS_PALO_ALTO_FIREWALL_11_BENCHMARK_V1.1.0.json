A Key ID and a pre-shared secret comprise a unique pair called a post-quantum pre-shared key (PQ PPK). Each IKEv2 peer uses the Key ID to look up the pre-shared secret, which is transmitted securely between administrators or pushed by Panorama, and stored locally on each IKEv2 peer. The pre-shared key is never part of the peering exchange and never traverses the post-quantum VPN, so an attacker using a quantum computer can't steal it, crack it, and use it to decrypt data harvested from a VPN. Both IKEv2 peers must have the same active pairs of Key ID plus pre-shared secret so that when peers negotiate the connection, each peer can look up the same Key ID and retrieve the same pre-shared secret.

    "rationale": "Without SSL inspection, the firewall cannot apply many of its protection features against encrypted traffic. The amount of encrypted malware traffic continues to rise, and legitimate websites using SSL encryption are hacked or tricked into delivering malware on a frequent basis. As encryption on the Internet continues to grow at a rapid rate, SSL inspection is no longer optional as a practical security measure. If proper decryption is not configured, it follows that the majority of traffic is not being fully inspected for malicious content or policy violations. This is a major exposure, allowing delivery of exploits and payloads direct to user desktops. Note that, categories to be decrypted is highly dependant on each organization's policy. Impact: Failure to decrypt outbound traffic allows attackers to mask attacks, data exfiltration and/or command and control (C2) traffic by simply using standard TLS encryption. Privacy concerns for your organization's users will dictate that some common categories should be exempted from inspection and decryption. Personal banking or healthcare information is almost always exempted, as are interactions with government entities. Exemptions and inclusions to decryption policies should be negotiated internally and governed by published Corporate Policies.",

    "assessment": "Automated",
    "description": "The CA Certificate used for in-line HTTP Man in the Middle should be trusted by target users. For SSL Forward Proxy configurations, there are classes of users that need to be considered. 1: Users that are members of the organization, users of machines under control of the organization. For these people and machines, ensure that the CA Certificate is in one of the Trusted CA certificate stores. This is easily done in Active Directory, using Group Policies for instance. A MDM (Mobile Device Manager) can be used to accomplish the same task for mobile devices such as telephones or tablets. Other central management or orchestration tools can be used for Linux or \"IoT\" (Internet of Things) devices. 2: Users that are not member of the organization - often these are classed as \"Visitors\" in the policies of the organization. If a public CA Certificate is a possibility for your organization, then that is one approach. A second approach is to not decrypt affected traffic - this is easily done, but leaves the majority of \"visitor\" traffic uninspected and potentially carrying malicious content. The final approach, and the one most commonly seen, is to use the same certificate as is used for the hosting organization. In this last case, visitors will see a certificate warning, but the issuing CA will be the organization that they are visiting.",
    "rationale": "Using a self-signed certificate, or any certificate that generates a warning in the browser, means that members of the organization have no method of determining if they are being presented with a legitimate certificate, or an attacker's \"man in the middle' certificate. It also very rapidly teaches members of the organization to bypass all security warnings of this type.",
