Priority determines the role that each VRRP router plays and what happens if the master virtual router fails. If a VRRP router owns the IP address of the virtual router and the IP address of the physical interface, this router functions as a master virtual router. Priority also determines if a VRRP router functions as a backup virtual router and determines the order of ascendancy to becoming a master virtual router if the master virtual router fails. You can configure the priority of each backup virtual router with a value of 1 through 254, using the vrrp priority command. For example, if Router A, the master virtual router in a LAN topology, fails, an election process takes place to determine if backup virtual Routers B or C should take over. If Routers B and C are configured with the priorities of 101 and 100, respectively, Router B is elected to become master virtual router because it has the higher priority. If Routers B and C are both configured with the priority of 100, the backup virtual router with the higher IP address is elected to become the master virtual router. By default, a preemptive scheme is enabled whereby a higher-priority backup virtual router that becomes available takes over for the backup virtual router that was elected to become master virtual router. You can disable this preemptive scheme using the no vrrp preempt command. If preemption is disabled, the backup virtual router that is elected to become master virtual router remains the master until the original master virtual router recovers and becomes master again.",

    "impact": "Unicast Reverse Path Forwarding (URPF) is a mechanism for validating the source IP address of packets received on a router. A router configured with URPF performs a reverse path lookup in the FIB table tovalidate the presence of the source IP address. If the source IP address is listed in the table, then it indicatesthat the source is reachable and valid. If source IP address cannot be located in the FIB table, the packet istreated as malicious by the router and discarded.",
