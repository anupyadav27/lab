IF a device is upgraded from IOS XE 16.9 or later the type 5 is auto converted to type 9. Use the enable secret command to provide an additional layer of security over the enable password. The enable secret command provides better security by storing the enable secret password using a nonreversible cryptographic function. The added layer of security encryption provides is useful in environments where the password crosses the network or is stored on a TFTP server.",
    "rationale": "Requiring the enable secret setting protects privileged EXEC mode. By default, a strong password is not required, a user can just press the Enter key at the Password prompt to start privileged mode.

Impact: Default device configuration does not require strong user authentication potentially enabling unfettered access to an attacker that is able to reach the device.
