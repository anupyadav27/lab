This is useful if you have lots of services running on a VM and you want to assign each service a different IP address without quota limitation.",
    "rationale": "With the feature of ENI multiple IP mode, Kubernetes Engine clusters can allocate IP addresses from a CIDR block known to Terway network plugin. This makes your cluster more scalable and allows your cluster to better interact with other Alibaba Cloud products and entities. Using ENI multiple IPs has several benefits: \u2022 Pod IPs are reserved within the network ahead of time, which prevents conflict with other compute resources. \u2022 Firewall controls for Pods can be applied separately from their nodes. \u2022 Alias IPs allow Pods to directly access hosted services without using a NAT gateway.",

In a private cluster, nodes do not have public IP addresses, so your workloads run in an environment that is isolated from the internet. Nodes have addresses only in the private address space. Nodes and masters communicate with each other privately using VPC peering.",
    "rationale": "With a Private cluster enabled, VPC network peering gives you several advantages over using external IP addresses or VPNs to connect networks, including: \u2022 Network Latency: Public IP networking suffers higher latency than private networking. \u2022 Network Security: Service owners do not need to have their services exposed to the public Internet to reduce any associated risks. \u2022 Network Cost: Alibaba Cloud charges egress bandwidth pricing for networks using external IPs to communicate even if the traffic is within the same zone. If, however, the networks are peered they can use internal IPs to communicate and save on those egress costs. Regular network pricing still applies to all traffic.",
