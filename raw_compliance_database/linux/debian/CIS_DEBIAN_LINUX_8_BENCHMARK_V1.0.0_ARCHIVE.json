This provides protection for resource exhaustion and enables the use of mounting options that are applicable to the directory's intended use. User's data can be stored on separate partitions and have stricter mount options. A user partition is a filesystem that has been established for use by the users and does not contain software for system operations. The directives in this section are easier to perform during initial system installation. If the system is already installed, it is recommended that a full backup be performed before repartitioning the system. Note: If you are repartitioning a system that has already been installed, make sure the data has been copied over to the new partition, unmount it and then remove the data from the directory that was in the old partition. Otherwise it will still consume space in the old partition that will be masked when the new filesystem is mounted. For example, if a system is in single-user mode with no filesystems mounted and the administrator adds a lot of data to the /tmp directory, this data will still consume space in / once the /tmp filesystem is mounted unless it is removed first.",

This guidance recommends disabling the software however removal is also an acceptable remediation.

It is recommended that rsyslog be used for logging (with logwatch providing summarization) and auditd be used for auditing (with aureport providing summarization) to automatically monitor logs for intrusion attempts and other suspicious system behavior. In addition to the local log files created by the steps in this section, it is also recommended that sites collect copies of their system logs on a secure, centralized log server via an encrypted connection. Not only does centralized logging help sites correlate events that may be occurring on multiple systems, but having a second copy of the system log information may be critical after a system compromise where the attacker has modified the local log files on the affected system(s). If a log correlation system is deployed, configure it to process the logs described in this section. Because it is often necessary to correlate log information from many different systems (particularly after a security incident) it is recommended that the time be synchronized among systems and devices connected to the local network. The standard Internet protocol for time synchronization is the Network Time Protocol (NTP), which is supported by most network-ready devices. See the ntpd(8) manual page for more information on configuring NTP. It is important that all logs described in this section be monitored on a regular basis and correlated to determine trends. A seemingly innocuous entry in one log could be more significant when compared to an entry in another log. Note on log file permissions: There really isn't a \"one size fits all\" solution to the permissions on log files. Many sites utilize group permissions so that administrators who are in a defined security group, such as \"wheel\" do not have to elevate privileges to root in order to read log files. Also, if a third party log aggregation tool is used, it may need to have group permissions to read the log files, which is preferable to having it run setuid to root. Therefore, there are two remediation and audit steps for log file permissions. One is for systems that do not have a secured group method implemented that only permits root to read the log files (root:root 600). The other is for sites that do have such a setup and are designated as root:securegrp 640 where securegrp is the defined security group (in some cases wheel).  77 | P a g e 8.1 Configure System Accounting (auditd) System auditing, through auditd, allows system administrators to monitor their systems such that they can detect unauthorized access or modification of data. By default, auditd will audit SELinux AVC denials, system logins, account modifications, and authentication events. Events will be logged to /var/log/audit/audit.log. The recording of these events will use a modest amount of disk space on a system. If significantly more events are captured, additional on system or off system storage may need to be allocated. Note: For 64 bit systems that have arch as a rule parameter, you will need two rules: one for 64 bit and one for 32 bit systems. For 32 bit systems, only one rule is needed. 8.1.1 Configure Data Retention When auditing, it is important to carefully configure the storage requirements for audit logs. By default, auditd will max out the log files at 5MB and retain only 4 copies of them. Older versions will be deleted. It is possible on a system that the 20 MBs of audit logs may fill up the system causing loss of audit data. While the recommendations here provide guidance, check your site policy for audit storage requirements. Note: Items in this section configure auditd, ensure it is installed per 8.1.2 Install and Enable auditd Service.",

Tracking write system calls could quickly fill up the audit log and is not recommended. Recommendations on configuration options to track data export to media is beyond the scope of this document.
