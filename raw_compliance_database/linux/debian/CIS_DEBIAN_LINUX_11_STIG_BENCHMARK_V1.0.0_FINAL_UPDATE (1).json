Impact: As Snap packages utilizes squashfs as a compressed filesystem, disabling squashfs will cause Snap packages to fail. Snap application packages of software are self-contained and work across a range of Linux distributions. This is unlike traditional Linux package management approaches, like APT or RPM, which require specifically adapted packages per Linux distribution on an application update and delay therefore application deployment from developers to their software’s end-user. Snaps themselves have no dependency on any external store (“App store”), can be obtained from any source and can be therefore used for upstream software deployment.",

Selection of a cryptographic mechanism is based on the need to protect the integrity of organizational information. The strength of the mechanism is commensurate with the security category and/or classification of the information. Organizations have the flexibility to either encrypt all information on storage devices (i.e., full disk encryption) or encrypt specific data structures (e.g., files, records, or fields).",

    "title": "Ensure /tmp is a separate partition",
    "assessment": "Automated",
    "description": "The /tmp directory is a world-writable directory used for temporary storage by all users and some applications. If an entry for /tmp exists in /etc/fstab it will take precedence over entries in systemd default unit file. Note: In an environment where the main system is diskless and connected to iSCSI, entries in /etc/fstab may not take precedence. /tmp can be configured to use tmpfs. tmpfs puts everything into the kernel internal caches and grows and shrinks to accommodate the files it contains and is able to swap unneeded pages out to swap space. It has maximum size limits which can be adjusted on the fly via mount -o remount. Since tmpfs lives completely in the page cache and on swap, all tmpfs pages will be shown as \"Shmem\" in /proc/meminfo and \"Shared\" in free. Notice that these counters also include shared memory. The most reliable way to get the count is using df and du. tmpfs has three mount options for sizing: • size: The limit of allocated bytes for this tmpfs instance. The default is half of your physical RAM without swap. If you oversize your tmpfs instances the machine will deadlock since the OOM handler will not be able to free that memory. • nr_blocks: The same as size, but in blocks of PAGE_SIZE. • nr_inodes: The maximum number of inodes for this instance. The default is half of the number of your physical RAM pages, or (on a machine with highmem) the number of lowmem RAM pages, whichever is the lower. These parameters accept a suffix k, m or g and can be changed on remount. The size parameter also accepts a suffix % to limit this tmpfs instance to that percentage of your physical RAM. The default, when neither size nor nr_blocks is specified, is size=50%.",
    "rationale": "Making /tmp its own file system allows an administrator to set additional mount options such as the noexec option on the mount, making /tmp useless for an attacker to install executable code. It would also prevent an attacker from establishing a hard link to a system setuid program and wait for it to be updated. Once the program was updated, the hard link would be broken and the attacker would have his own copy of the program. If the program happened to have a security vulnerability, the attacker could continue to exploit the known flaw. This can be accomplished by either mounting tmpfs to /tmp, or creating a separate partition for /tmp. Impact: By design files saved to /tmp should have no expectation of surviving a reboot of the system. tmpfs is ram based and all files stored to tmpfs will be lost when the system is rebooted. If files need to be persistent through a reboot, they should be saved to /var/tmp not /tmp. Since the /tmp directory is intended to be world-writable, there is a risk of resource exhaustion if it is not bound to tmpfs or a separate partition. Running out of /tmp space is a problem regardless of what kind of filesystem lies under it, but in a configuration where /tmp is not a separate file system it will essentially have the whole disk available, as the default installation only creates a single / partition. On the other hand, a RAM-based /tmp (as with tmpfs) will almost certainly be much smaller, which can lead to applications filling up the filesystem much more easily. Another alternative is to create a dedicated partition for /tmp from a separate volume or disk. One of the downsides of a disk-based dedicated partition is that it will be slower than tmpfs which is RAM-based.",
    "audit": "Run the following command and verify the output shows that /tmp is mounted. Particular requirements pertaining to mount options are covered in ensuing sections. # findmnt -nk /tmp Example output: /tmp   tmpfs  tmpfs  rw,nosuid,nodev,noexec Ensure that systemd will mount the /tmp partition at boot time. # systemctl is-enabled tmp.mount Example output: generated Verify output is not masked or disabled. Note: By default systemd will output generated if there is an entry in /etc/fstab for /tmp.

    "description": "The auditing daemon, auditd, stores log data in the /var/log/audit directory.",
    "rationale": "The reasoning for mounting /var/log/audit on a separate partition is as follows. Protection from resource exhaustion The default installation only creates a single / partition. Since the /var/log/audit directory contains the audit.log file which can grow quite large, there is a risk of resource exhaustion. It will essentially have the whole disk available to fill up and impact the system as a whole. In addition, other operations on the system could fill up the disk unrelated to /var/log/audit and cause auditd to trigger it's space_left_action as the disk is full. See man auditd.conf for details. Fine grained control over the mount Configuring /var/log/audit as its own file system allows an administrator to set additional mount options such as noexec/nosuid/nodev. These options limit an attacker's ability to create exploits on the system. Other options allow for specific behavior. See man mount for exact details regarding filesystem-independent and filesystem-specific options. Protection of audit data As /var/log/audit contains audit logs, care should be taken to ensure the security and integrity of the data and mount point. Impact: Resizing filesystems is a common activity in cloud-hosted servers. Separate filesystem partitions may prevent successful resizing, or may require the installation of additional tools solely for the purpose of resizing operations. The use of these additional tools may introduce their own security considerations.",

    "description": "ntp Access Control Commands: restrict address [mask mask] [ippeerlimit int] [flag ...] The address argument expressed in dotted-quad form is the address of a host or network. Alternatively, the address argument can be a valid host DNS name. The mask argument expressed in dotted-quad form defaults to 255.255.255.255, meaning that the address is treated as the address of an individual host. A default entry (address 0.0.0.0, mask 0.0.0.0) is always included and is always the first entry in the list. Note: the text string default, with no mask option, may be used to indicate the default entry. The ippeerlimit directive limits the number of peer requests for each IP to int, where a value of -1 means \"unlimited\", the current default. A value of 0 means \"none\". There would usually be at most 1 peering request per IP, but if the remote peering requests are behind a proxy there could well be more than 1 per IP. In the current implementation, flag always restricts access, i.e., an entry with no flags indicates that free access to the server is to be given. The flags are not orthogonal, in that more restrictive flags will often make less restrictive ones redundant. The flags can generally be classed into two categories, those which restrict time service and those which restrict informational queries and attempts to do run-time reconfiguration of the server. One or more of the following flags may be specified: • kod - If this flag is set when an access violation occurs, a kiss-o'-death (KoD) packet is sent. KoD packets are rate limited to no more than one per second. If another KoD packet occurs within one second after the last one, the packet is dropped. • limited - Deny service if the packet spacing violates the lower limits specified in the discard command. A history of clients is kept using the monitoring capability of ntpd. Thus, monitoring is always active as long as there is a restriction entry with the limited flag. • lowpriotrap - Declare traps set by matching hosts to be low priority. The number of traps a server can maintain is limited (the current limit is 3). Traps are usually assigned on a first come, first served basis, with later trap requestors being denied service. This flag modifies the assignment algorithm by allowing low priority traps to be overridden by later requests for normal priority traps.  • noepeer - Deny ephemeral peer requests, even if they come from an authenticated source. Note that the ability to use a symmetric key for authentication may be restricted to one or more IPs or subnets via the third field of the ntp.keys file. This restriction is not enabled by default, to maintain backward compatibility. Expect noepeer to become the default in ntp-4.4. • nomodify - Deny ntpq and ntpdc queries which attempt to modify the state of the server (i.e., run time reconfiguration). Queries which return information are permitted. • noquery - Deny ntpq and ntpdc queries. Time service is not affected. • nopeer - Deny unauthenticated packets which would result in mobilizing a new association. This includes broadcast and symmetric active packets when a configured association does not exist. It also includes pool associations, so if you want to use servers from a pool directive and also want to use nopeer by default, you'll want a restrict source ... line as well that does not include the nopeer directive. • noserve - Deny all packets except ntpq and ntpdc queries. • notrap - Decline to provide mode 6 control message trap service to matching hosts. The trap service is a subsystem of the ntpq control message protocol which is intended for use by remote event logging programs. • notrust - Deny service unless the packet is cryptographically authenticated. • ntpport - This is actually a match algorithm modifier, rather than a restriction flag. Its presence causes the restriction entry to be matched only if the source port in the packet is the standard NTP UDP port (123). Both ntpport and non- ntpport may be specified. The ntpport is considered more specific and is sorted later in the list.",

Note: That only those options applicable to each command are listed below. Use of options not listed may not be caught as an error, but may result in some weird and even destructive behavior. If the Basic Socket Interface Extensions for IPv6 (RFC-2553) is detected, support for the IPv6 address family is generated in addition to the default support of the IPv4 address family. In a few cases, including the reslist billboard generated by ntpq or ntpdc, IPv6 addresses are automatically generated. IPv6 addresses can be identified by the presence of colons “:” in the address field. IPv6 addresses can be used almost everywhere where IPv4 addresses can be used, with the exception of reference clock addresses, which are always IPv4. Note: In contexts where a host name is expected, a -4 qualifier preceding the host name forces DNS resolution to the IPv4 namespace, while a -6 qualifier forces DNS resolution to the IPv6 namespace. See IPv6 references for the equivalent classes for that address family. • pool - For type s addresses, this command mobilizes a persistent client mode association with a number of remote servers. In this mode the local clock can synchronized to the remote server, but the remote server can never be synchronized to the local clock. • server - For type s and r addresses, this command mobilizes a persistent client mode association with the specified remote server or local radio clock. In this mode the local clock can synchronized to the remote server, but the remote server can never be synchronized to the local clock. This command should not be used for type b or m addresses.",

In contrast, non-source routed packets travel a path determined by routers in the network.

Assume this system was capable of routing packets to Internet routable addresses on one interface and private addresses on another interface. Assume that the private addresses were not routable to the Internet routable addresses and vice versa. Under normal routing circumstances, an attacker from the Internet routable addresses could not use the system as a way to reach the private address systems. If, however, source routed packets were allowed, they could be used to gain access to the private address systems as the route could be specified, rather than rely on routing protocols that did not allow this routing.",

Each user can have their own crontab, and though these are files in /var/spool/cron/crontabs, they are not intended to be edited directly. If the /etc/cron.allow file exists, then you must be listed (one user per line) therein in order to be allowed to use this command. If the /etc/cron.allow file does not exist but the /etc/cron.deny file does exist, then you must not be listed in the /etc/cron.deny file in order to use this command. If neither of these files exists, then depending on site-dependent configuration parameters, only the super user will be allowed to use this command, or all users will be able to use this command. If both files exist then /etc/cron.allow takes precedence. Which means that /etc/cron.deny is not considered and your user must be listed in /etc/cron.allow in order to be able to use the crontab. Regardless of the existence of any of these files, the root administrative user is always allowed to setup a crontab. The files /etc/cron.allow and /etc/cron.deny, if they exist, must be either world- readable, or readable by group crontab. If they are not, then cron will deny access to all users until the permissions are fixed. There is one file for each user's crontab under the /var/spool/cron/crontabs directory. Users are not allowed to edit the files under that directory directly to ensure that only users allowed by the system to run periodic tasks can add them, and only syntactically correct crontabs will be written there. This is enforced by having the directory writable only by the crontab group and configuring crontab command with the setgid bid set for that specific group. Note: • Even though a given user is not listed in cron.allow, cron jobs can still be run as that user • The files /etc/cron.allow and /etc/cron.deny, if they exist, only controls administrative access to the crontab command for scheduling and modifying cron jobs",

The specification of a date must follow the specification of the time of day. You can also give times like now + count time-units, where the time-units can be minutes, hours, days, or weeks and you can tell at to run the job today by suffixing the time with today and to run the job tomorrow by suffixing the time with tomorrow. The /etc/at.allow and /etc/at.deny files determine which user can submit commands for later execution via at or batch. The format of the files is a list of usernames, one on each line.

    "title": "Ensure SSH Idle Timeout Interval is configured",
    "assessment": "Automated",
    "description": "Note: To clarify, the two settings described below are only meant for idle connections from a protocol perspective and are not meant to check if the user is active or not. An idle user does not mean an idle connection. SSH does not and never had, intentionally, the capability to drop idle users. In SSH versions before 8.2p1 there was a bug that caused these values to behave in such a manner that they were abused to disconnect idle users. This bug has been resolved in 8.2p1 and thus it can no longer be abused disconnect idle users. The two options ClientAliveInterval and ClientAliveCountMax control the timeout of SSH sessions. Taken directly from man 5 sshd_config: • ClientAliveInterval Sets a timeout interval in seconds after which if no data has been received from the client, sshd(8) will send a message through the encrypted channel to request a response from the client. The default is 0, indicating that these messages will not be sent to the client. • ClientAliveCountMax Sets the number of client alive messages which may be sent without sshd(8) receiving any messages back from the client. If this threshold is reached while client alive messages are being sent, sshd will disconnect the client, terminating the session. It is important to note that the use of client alive messages is very different from TCPKeepAlive. The client alive messages are sent through the encrypted channel and therefore will not be spoofable. The TCP keepalive option en‐abled by TCPKeepAlive is spoofable. The client alive mechanism is valuable when the client or server depend on knowing when a connection has become unresponsive. The default value is 3. If ClientAliveInterval is set to 15, and ClientAliveCountMax is left at the default, unresponsive SSH clients will be disconnected after approximately 45 seconds. Setting a zero ClientAliveCountMax disables connection termination.",
    "rationale": "In order to prevent resource exhaustion, appropriate values should be set for both ClientAliveInterval and ClientAliveCountMax. Specifically, looking at the source code, ClientAliveCountMax must be greater than zero in order to utilize the ability of SSH to drop idle connections. If connections are allowed to stay open indefinately, this can potentially be used as a DDOS attack or simple resource exhaustion could occur over unreliable networks. The example set here is a 45 second timeout. Consult your site policy for network timeouts and apply as appropriate.",

In Linux, the default permissions for any newly created directory is 0777 (rwxrwxrwx), and for any newly created file it is 0666 (rw-rw- rw-). The umask modifies the default Linux permissions by restricting (masking) these permissions. The umask is not simply subtracted, but is processed bitwise. Bits set in the umask are cleared in the resulting file mode. umask can be set with either octal or Symbolic values • Octal (Numeric) Value - Represented by either three or four digits. ie umask 0027 or umask 027. If a four digit umask is used, the first digit is ignored. The remaining three digits effect the resulting permissions for user, group, and world/other respectively. • Symbolic Value - Represented by a comma separated list for User u, group g, and world/other o. The permissions listed are not masked by umask. ie a umask set by umask u=rwx,g=rx,o= is the Symbolic equivalent of the Octal umask 027. This umask would set a newly created directory with file mode drwxr-x--- and a newly created file with file mode rw-r-----. Setting the default umask: • pam_umask module: o will set the umask according to the system default in /etc/login.defs and user settings, solving the problem of different umask settings with different shells, display managers, remote sessions etc. o umask=<mask> value in the /etc/login.defs file is interpreted as Octal o Setting USERGROUPS_ENAB to yes in /etc/login.defs (default): ▪ will enable setting of the umask group bits to be the same as owner bits. (examples: 022 -> 002, 077 -> 007) for non-root users, if the uid is the same as gid, and username is the same as the primary group name ▪ userdel will remove the user's group if it contains no more members, and useradd will create by default a group with the name of the user   • System Wide Shell Configuration File: o /etc/profile - used to set system wide environmental variables on users shells. The variables are sometimes the same ones that are in the .profile, however this file is used to set an initial PATH or PS1 for all shell users of the system. is only executed for interactive login shells, or shells executed with the --login parameter o /etc/profile.d - /etc/profile will execute the scripts within /etc/profile.d/*.sh. It is recommended to place your configuration in a shell script within /etc/profile.d to set your own system wide environmental variables. o /etc/bash.bashrc - System wide version of .bashrc. etc/bashrc also invokes /etc/profile.d/*.sh if non-login shell, but redirects output to /dev/null if non-interactive. Is only executed for interactive shells or if BASH_ENV is set to /etc/bash.bashrc User Shell Configuration Files: • ~/.profile - Is executed to configure your shell before the initial command prompt.

While tracking mount commands gives the system administrator evidence that external media may have been mounted (based on a review of the source of the mount and confirming it's an external media type), it does not conclusively indicate that data was exported to the media. System administrators who wish to determine if data were exported, would also have to track successful open, creat and truncate system calls requiring write access to a file under the mount point of the external media file system.
