By restricting how processes can access files and resources on a system the potential impact from vulnerabilities in the processes can be reduced. Impact: Mandatory Access Control limits the capabilities of applications and daemons on a system, while this can prevent unauthorized access the configuration of MAC can be complex and difficult to implement correctly preventing legitimate access from occurring. 74 | P a g e 1.6.1 Configure SELinux SELinux provides a Mandatory Access Control (MAC) system that greatly augments the default Discretionary Access Control (DAC) model. Under SELinux, every process and every object (files, sockets, pipes) on the system is assigned a security context, a label that includes detailed type information about the object. The kernel allows processes to access objects only if that access is explicitly allowed by the policy in effect. The policy defines transitions, so that a user can be allowed to run software, but the software can run under a different context than the user's default. This automatically limits the damage that the software can do to files accessible by the calling user. The user does not need to take any action to gain this benefit. For an action to occur, both the traditional DAC permissions must be satisfied as well as the SELinux MAC rules. The action will not be allowed if either one of these models does not permit the action. In this way, SELinux rules can only make a system's permissions more restrictive and secure. SELinux requires a complex policy to allow all the actions required of a system under normal operation. Three such policies have been designed for use with RHEL7 and are included with the system: targeted, strict, and mls. These are described as follows:  targeted: consists mostly of Type Enforcement (TE) rules, and a small number of Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) rules. Targeted restricts the actions of many types of programs, but leaves interactive users largely unaffected.  strict: also uses TE and RBAC rules, but on more programs and more aggressively.  mls: implements Multi-Level Security (MLS), which introduces even more kinds of labels (sensitivity and category) and rules that govern access based on these. This section provides guidance for the configuration of the targetedpolicy. Note: This section only applies if SELinux is in use on the system.

Changing some of these login banners also has the side effect of hiding OS version information and other detailed system information from attackers attempting to target specific exploits at a system. Guidelines published by the US Department of Defense require that warning messages include at least the name of the organization that owns the system, the fact that the system is subject to monitoring and that such monitoring is in compliance with local statutes, and that use of the system implies consent to such monitoring. It is important that the organization's legal counsel review the content of all messages before any system modifications are made, as these warning messages are inherently site-specific. More information (including citations of relevant case law) can be found at http://www.justice.gov/criminal/cybercrime/ Note: The text provided in the remediation actions for these items is intended as an example only. Please edit to include the specific text for your organization as approved by your legal department. 84 | P a g e 1.7.1 Command Line Warning Banners The /etc/motd, /etc/issue, and /etc/issue.net files govern warning banners for standard command line logins for both local and remote users.",

While several methods of configuration exist this section is intended only to ensure the resulting IPtables rules are in place, not how they are configured. If IPv6 is in use in your environment, similar settings should be applied to the IP6tables as well. Note: This section broadly assumes starting with an empty IPtables firewall ruleset (established by flushing the rules with iptables -F). Remediation steps included only affect the live system, you will also need to configure your default firewall configuration to apply on boot. Configuration of a live systems firewall directly over a remote connection will often result in being locked out. It is advised to have a known good firewall configuration set to run on boot and to configure an entire firewall structure in a script that is then run and tested before saving to boot. The following script will implement the firewall rules of this section and open port 22(ssh) from anywhere: #!/bin/bash # Flush IPtables rules iptables -F # Ensure default deny firewall policy iptables -P INPUT DROP iptables -P OUTPUT DROP iptables -P FORWARD DROP # Ensure loopback traffic is configured iptables -A INPUT -i lo -j ACCEPT iptables -A OUTPUT -o lo -j ACCEPT iptables -A INPUT -s 127.0.0.0/8 -j DROP # Ensure outbound and established connections are configured iptables -A OUTPUT -p tcp -m state --state NEW,ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT iptables -A OUTPUT -p udp -m state --state NEW,ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT iptables -A OUTPUT -p icmp -m state --state NEW,ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT iptables -A INPUT -p tcp -m state --state ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT iptables -A INPUT -p udp -m state --state ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT iptables -A INPUT -p icmp -m state --state ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT # Open inbound ssh(tcp port 22) connections iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 22 -m state --state NEW -j ACCEPT",

It is recommended that rsyslogbe used for logging (with logwatchproviding summarization) and auditd be used for auditing (with aureportproviding summarization) to automatically monitor logs for intrusion attempts and other suspicious system behavior. In addition to the local log files created by the steps in this section, it is also recommended that sites collect copies of their system logs on a secure, centralized log server via an encrypted connection. Not only does centralized logging help sites correlate events that may be occurring on multiple systems, but having a second copy of the system log information may be critical after a system compromise where the attacker has modified the local log files on the affected system(s). If a log correlation system is deployed, configure it to process the logs described in this section. Because it is often necessary to correlate log information from many different systems (particularly after a security incident) it is recommended that the time be synchronized among systems and devices connected to the local network. The standard Internet protocol for time synchronization is the Network Time Protocol (NTP), which is supported by most network-ready devices. See the ntpd(8) manual page for more information on configuring NTP. It is important that all logs described in this section be monitored on a regular basis and correlated to determine trends. A seemingly innocuous entry in one log could be more significant when compared to an entry in another log. Note on log file permissions: There really isn't a \"one size fits all\" solution to the permissions on log files. Many sites utilize group permissions so that administrators who are in a defined security group, such as \"wheel\" do not have to elevate privileges to root in order to read log files. Also, if a third party log aggregation tool is used, it may need to have group permissions to read the log files, which is preferable to having it run setuid to root. Therefore, there are two remediation and audit steps for log file permissions. One is for systems that do not have a secured group method implemented that only permits root to read the log files (root:root 600). The other is for sites that do have such a setup and are designated as root:securegrp 640where securegrpis the defined security group (in some cases wheel). 186 | P a g e 4.1 Configure System Accounting (auditd) System auditing, through auditd, allows system administrators to monitor their systems such that they can detect unauthorized access or modification of data. By default, auditd will audit SELinux AVC denials, system logins, account modifications, and authentication events. Events will be logged to /var/log/audit/audit.log. The recording of these events will use a modest amount of disk space on a system. If significantly more events are captured, additional on system or off system storage may need to be allocated. The recommendations in this section implement an audit policy that produces large quantities of logged data. In some environments it can be challenging to store or process these logs and as such they are marked as Level 2 for both Servers and Workstations. Note: For 64 bit systems that have arch as a rule parameter, you will need two rules: one for 64 bit and one for 32 bit systems. For 32 bit systems, only one rule is needed. Note: Once all configuration changes have been made to /etc/audit/audit.rules, the auditd configuration must be reloaded: # service auditd reload 187 | P a g e 4.1.1 Configure Data Retention When auditing, it is important to carefully configure the storage requirements for audit logs. By default, auditd will max out the log files at 5MB and retain only 4 copies of them. Older versions will be deleted. It is possible on a system that the 20 MBs of audit logs may fill up the system causing loss of audit data. While the recommendations here provide guidance, check your site policy for audit storage requirements.",

For devices 185 | P a g e that do not have an essential wireless business purpose, disable wireless access in the hardware configuration (basic input/output system or extensible firmware interface). 4 Logging and Auditing The items in this section describe how to configure logging, log monitoring, and auditing, using tools included in most distributions. It is recommended that rsyslogbe used for logging (with logwatchproviding summarization) and auditd be used for auditing (with aureportproviding summarization) to automatically monitor logs for intrusion attempts and other suspicious system behavior. In addition to the local log files created by the steps in this section, it is also recommended that sites collect copies of their system logs on a secure, centralized log server via an encrypted connection. Not only does centralized logging help sites correlate events that may be occurring on multiple systems, but having a second copy of the system log information may be critical after a system compromise where the attacker has modified the local log files on the affected system(s). If a log correlation system is deployed, configure it to process the logs described in this section. Because it is often necessary to correlate log information from many different systems (particularly after a security incident) it is recommended that the time be synchronized among systems and devices connected to the local network. The standard Internet protocol for time synchronization is the Network Time Protocol (NTP), which is supported by most network-ready devices. See the ntpd(8) manual page for more information on configuring NTP. It is important that all logs described in this section be monitored on a regular basis and correlated to determine trends. A seemingly innocuous entry in one log could be more significant when compared to an entry in another log. Note on log file permissions: There really isn't a \"one size fits all\" solution to the permissions on log files. Many sites utilize group permissions so that administrators who are in a defined security group, such as \"wheel\" do not have to elevate privileges to root in order to read log files.

M      File mode differs (includes permissions and file type). 5      The MD5 checksum differs. D      The major and minor version numbers differ on a device file. L      A mismatch occurs in a link. U      The file ownership differs. G      The file group owner differs. T      The file time (mtime) differs. The rpm -qf command can be used to determine which package a particular file belongs to. For example the following commands determines which package the /bin/bash file belongs to: # rpm -qf /bin/bash bash-4.1.2-29.el6.x86_64 To verify the settings for the package that controls the /bin/bash file, run the following: # rpm -V bash-4.1.2-29.el6.x86_64 .M.......    /bin/bash Note that you can feed the output of the rpm -qf command to the rpm -V command: # rpm -V `rpm -qf /etc/passwd` .M...... c /etc/passwd S.5....T c /etc/printcap",
