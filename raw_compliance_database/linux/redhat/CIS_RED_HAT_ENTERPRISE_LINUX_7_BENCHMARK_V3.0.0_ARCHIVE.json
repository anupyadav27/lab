    "description": "Data from journald may be stored in volatile memory or persisted locally on the server. Utilities exist to accept remote export of journald logs, however, use of the rsyslog service provides a consistent means of log collection and export. Notes: \uf0b7 This recommendation assumes that recommendation 4.2.1.5, \"Ensure rsyslog is configured to send logs to a remote log host\" has been implemented. \uf0b7 The main configuration file /etc/systemd/journald.conf is read before any of the custom *.conf files. If there are custom configs present, they override the main configuration parameters \uf0b7 As noted in the journald man pages: journald logs may be exported to rsyslog either through the process mentioned here, or through a facility like systemd- journald.service. There are trade-offs involved in each implementation, where ForwardToSyslog will immediately capture all events (and forward to an external log server, if properly configured), but may not capture all boot-up activities. Mechanisms such as systemd-journald.service, on the other hand, will record bootup events, but may delay sending the information to rsyslog, leading to the potential for log manipulation prior to export. Be aware of the limitations of all tools employed to secure a system.",

Notes : \uf0b7 Additional module options may be set, recommendation only covers those listed here. \uf0b7 When modifying authentication configuration using the authconfig utility, the system- auth and password-auth files are overwritten with the settings from the authconfig utility. This can be avoided by creating symbolic links in place of the configuration files, which authconfig recognizes and does not overwrite. These symbolic links are the default for Fedora 19 derived distributions. \uf0b7 Use of the \"audit\" keyword may log credentials in the case of user error during authentication. This risk should be evaluated in the context of the site policies of your organization. \uf0b7 If a user has been locked out because they have reached the maximum consecutive failure count defined by deny= in the pam_faillock.so or the pam_tally2.so module, the user can be unlocked by issuing following commands. This command sets the failed count to 0, effectively unlocking the user. o If pam_faillock.so is used: o # faillock --user <username> --reset o If pam_tally2.so is used: o # pam_tally2 -u <username> --reset  438 | P a g e",

The umask modifies the default Linux permissions by restricting (masking) these permissions. The umask is not simply subtracted, but is processed bitwise. Bits set in the umask are cleared in the resulting file mode. umask can be set with either octal or Symbolic values \uf0b7 Octal (Numeric) Value - Represented by either three or four digits. ie umask 0027 or umask 027.
