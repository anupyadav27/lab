    "title": "Ensure /tmp is a separate partition",
    "assessment": "Automated",
    "description": "The /tmp directory is a world-writable directory used for temporary storage by all users and some applications. -IF- an entry for /tmp exists in /etc/fstab it will take precedence over entries in systemd default unit file. Note: In an environment where the main system is diskless and connected to iSCSI, entries in /etc/fstab may not take precedence. /tmp can be configured to use tmpfs. tmpfs puts everything into the kernel internal caches and grows and shrinks to accommodate the files it contains and is able to swap unneeded pages out to swap space. It has maximum size limits which can be adjusted on the fly via mount -o remount. Since tmpfs lives completely in the page cache and on swap, all tmpfs pages will be shown as \"Shmem\" in /proc/meminfo and \"Shared\" in free. Notice that these counters also include shared memory. The most reliable way to get the count is using df and du. tmpfs has three mount options for sizing: \u2022 size: The limit of allocated bytes for this tmpfs instance. The default is half of your physical RAM without swap. If you oversize your tmpfs instances the machine will deadlock since the OOM handler will not be able to free that memory. \u2022 nr_blocks: The same as size, but in blocks of PAGE_SIZE. \u2022 nr_inodes: The maximum number of inodes for this instance. The default is half of the number of your physical RAM pages, or (on a machine with highmem) the number of lowmem RAM pages, whichever is the lower. These parameters accept a suffix k, m or g and can be changed on remount. The size parameter also accepts a suffix % to limit this tmpfs instance to that percentage of your physical RAM. The default, when neither size nor nr_blocks is specified, is size=50%.",
    "rationale": "Making /tmp its own file system allows an administrator to set additional mount options such as the noexec option on the mount, making /tmp useless for an attacker to install executable code. It would also prevent an attacker from establishing a hard link to a system setuid program and wait for it to be updated. Once the program was updated, the hard link would be broken, and the attacker would have his own copy of the program. If the program happened to have a security vulnerability, the attacker could continue to exploit the known flaw. This can be accomplished by either mounting tmpfs to /tmp, or creating a separate partition for /tmp. Impact: By design files saved to /tmp should have no expectation of surviving a reboot of the system. tmpfs is ram based and all files stored to tmpfs will be lost when the system is rebooted. If files need to be persistent through a reboot, they should be saved to /var/tmp not /tmp. Since the /tmp directory is intended to be world-writable, there is a risk of resource exhaustion if it is not bound to tmpfs or a separate partition. Running out of /tmp space is a problem regardless of what kind of filesystem lies under it, but in a configuration where /tmp is not a separate file system it will essentially have the whole disk available, as the default installation only creates a single / partition. On the other hand, a RAM-based /tmp (as with tmpfs) will almost certainly be much smaller, which can lead to applications filling up the filesystem much more easily. Another alternative is to create a dedicated partition for /tmp from a separate volume or disk. One of the downsides of a disk-based dedicated partition is that it will be slower than tmpfs which is RAM-based.",

By restricting how processes can access files and resources on a system the potential impact from vulnerabilities in the processes can be reduced. Impact: Mandatory Access Control limits the capabilities of applications and daemons on a system, while this can prevent unauthorized access the configuration of MAC can be complex and difficult to implement correctly preventing legitimate access from occurring.  1.5.1 Configure SELinux SELinux implements Mandatory Access Control (MAC). Every process and system resource has a special security label called an SELinux context. A SELinux context, sometimes referred to as an SELinux label, is an identifier which abstracts away the system-level details and focuses on the security properties of the entity. Not only does this provide a consistent way of referencing objects in the SELinux policy, but it also removes any ambiguity that can be found in other identification methods. For example, a file can have multiple valid path names on a system that makes use of bind mounts. The SELinux policy uses these contexts in a series of rules which define how processes can interact with each other and the various system resources. By default, the policy does not allow any interaction unless a rule explicitly grants access. In Fedora 28 Family Linux distributions, system services are controlled by the systemd daemon; systemd starts and stops all services, and users and processes communicate with systemd using the systemctl utility. The systemd daemon can consult the SELinux policy and check the label of the calling process and the label of the unit file that the caller tries to manage, and then ask SELinux whether or not the caller is allowed the access. This approach strengthens access control to critical system capabilities, which include starting and stopping system services. This automatically limits the damage that the software can do to files accessible by the calling user. The user does not need to take any action to gain this benefit. For an action to occur, both the traditional DAC permissions must be satisfied as well as the SELinux MAC rules. The action will not be allowed if either one of these models does not permit the action. In this way, SELinux rules can only make a system's permissions more restrictive and secure. SELinux requires a complex policy to allow all the actions required of a system under normal operation. Two such policies have been designed for use with Fedora 28 Family Linux distributions and are included with the system: \u2022 targeted - Targeted processes run in their own domain, called a confined domain. In a confined domain, the files that a targeted process has access to are limited. If a confined process is compromised by an attacker, the attacker\u2019s access to resources and the possible damage they can do is also limited. SELinux denies access to these resources and logs the denial. \u2022 mls - Implements Multi-Level Security (MLS), which introduces even more kinds of labels (sensitivity and category) and rules that govern access based on these. This section provides guidance for the configuration of the targeted policy.   Note: \u2022 Remember that SELinux policy rules are checked after DAC rules. SELinux policy rules are not used if DAC rules deny access first, which means that no SELinux denial is logged if the traditional DAC rules prevent the access. \u2022 This section only applies if SELinux is in use on the system. Additional Mandatory Access Control systems exist. \u2022 To avoid incorrect SELinux labeling and subsequent problems, ensure that you start services using a systemctl start command.

While not recommended for production systems, permissive mode can be helpful for SELinux policy development. \u2022 Disabled - Is strongly discouraged; not only does the system avoid enforcing the SELinux policy, it also avoids labeling any persistent objects such as files, making it difficult to enable SELinux in the future Note: You can set individual domains to permissive mode while the system runs in enforcing mode.

    "description": "When tcp_syncookies is set, the kernel will handle TCP SYN packets normally until the half-open connection queue is full, at which time, the SYN cookie functionality kicks in. SYN cookies work by not using the SYN queue at all. Instead, the kernel simply replies to the SYN with a SYN|ACK, but will include a specially crafted TCP sequence number that encodes the source and destination IP address and port number and the time the packet was sent. A legitimate connection would send the ACK packet of the three way handshake with the specially crafted sequence number. This allows the system to verify that it has received a valid response to a SYN cookie and allow the connection, even though there is no corresponding SYN in the queue.",

    "description": "crontab is the program used to install, deinstall, or list the tables used to drive the cron daemon. Each user can have their own crontab, and though these are files in /var/spool/cron/crontabs, they are not intended to be edited directly. If the /etc/cron.allow file exists, then you must be listed (one user per line) therein in order to be allowed to use this command. If the /etc/cron.allow file does not exist but the /etc/cron.deny file does exist, then you must not be listed in the /etc/cron.deny file in order to use this command. If neither of these files exists, then depending on site-dependent configuration parameters, only the super user will be allowed to use this command, or all users will be able to use this command. If both files exist then /etc/cron.allow takes precedence. Which means that /etc/cron.deny is not considered and your user must be listed in /etc/cron.allow in order to be able to use the crontab. Regardless of the existence of any of these files, the root administrative user is always allowed to setup a crontab. The files /etc/cron.allow and /etc/cron.deny, if they exist, must be either world- readable, or readable by group crontab. If they are not, then cron will deny access to all users until the permissions are fixed. There is one file for each user's crontab under the /var/spool/cron/crontabs directory. Users are not allowed to edit the files under that directory directly to ensure that only users allowed by the system to run periodic tasks can add them, and only syntactically correct crontabs will be written there. This is enforced by having the directory writable only by the crontab group and configuring crontab command with the setgid bid set for that specific group. Note: \u2022 Even though a given user is not listed in cron.allow, cron jobs can still be run as that user \u2022 The files /etc/cron.allow and /etc/cron.deny, if they exist, only controls administrative access to the crontab command for scheduling and modifying cron jobs",

    "description": "at allows fairly complex time specifications, extending the POSIX.2 standard. It accepts times of the form HH:MM to run a job at a specific time of day. (If that time is already past, the next day is assumed.) You may also specify midnight, noon, or teatime (4pm) and you can have a time-of-day suffixed with AM or PM for running in the morning or the evening. You can also say what day the job will be run, by giving a date in the form month-name day with an optional year, or giving a date of the form MMDD[CC]YY, MM/DD/[CC]YY, DD.MM.[CC]YY or [CC]YY-MM-DD. The specification of a date must follow the specification of the time of day. You can also give times like now + count time-units, where the time-units can be minutes, hours, days, or weeks and you can tell at to run the job today by suffixing the time with today and to run the job tomorrow by suffixing the time with tomorrow. The /etc/at.allow and /etc/at.deny files determine which user can submit commands for later execution via at or batch. The format of the files is a list of usernames, one on each line. Whitespace is not permitted. If the file /etc/at.allow exists, only usernames mentioned in it are allowed to use at. If /etc/at.allow does not exist, /etc/at.deny is checked, every username not mentioned in it is then allowed to use at. An empty /etc/at.deny means that every user may use at.

    "assessment": "Automated",
    "description": "Note: To clarify, the two settings described below are only meant for idle connections from a protocol perspective and are not meant to check if the user is active or not. An idle user does not mean an idle connection. SSH does not and never had, intentionally, the capability to drop idle users. In SSH versions before 8.2p1 there was a bug that caused these values to behave in such a manner that they were abused to disconnect idle users. This bug has been resolved in 8.2p1 and thus it can no longer be abused disconnect idle users. The two options ClientAliveInterval and ClientAliveCountMax control the timeout of SSH sessions. Taken directly from man 5 sshd_config: \u2022 ClientAliveInterval Sets a timeout interval in seconds after which if no data has been received from the client, sshd(8) will send a message through the encrypted channel to request a response from the client. The default is 0, indicating that these messages will not be sent to the client. \u2022 ClientAliveCountMax Sets the number of client alive messages which may be sent without sshd(8) receiving any messages back from the client. If this threshold is reached while client alive messages are being sent, sshd will disconnect the client, terminating the session. It is important to note that the use of client alive messages is very different from TCPKeepAlive. The client alive messages are sent through the encrypted channel and therefore will not be spoofable. The TCP keepalive option en\u2010abled by TCPKeepAlive is spoofable. The client alive mechanism is valuable when the client or server depend on knowing when a connection has become unresponsive. The default value is 3. If ClientAliveInterval is set to 15, and ClientAliveCountMax is left at the default, unresponsive SSH clients will be disconnected after approximately 45 seconds. Setting a zero ClientAliveCountMax disables connection termination.",
    "rationale": "In order to prevent resource exhaustion, appropriate values should be set for both ClientAliveInterval and ClientAliveCountMax. Specifically, looking at the source code, ClientAliveCountMax must be greater than zero in order to utilize the ability of SSH to drop idle connections. If connections are allowed to stay open indefinitely, this can potentially be used as a DDOS attack or simple resource exhaustion could occur over unreliable networks. The example set here is a 45 second timeout. Consult your site policy for network timeouts and apply as appropriate.",

    "assessment": "Automated",
    "description": "The user file-creation mode mask (umask) is used to determine the file permission for newly created directories and files. In Linux, the default permissions for any newly created directory is 0777 (rwxrwxrwx), and for any newly created file it is 0666 (rw-rw- rw-). The umask modifies the default Linux permissions by restricting (masking) these permissions. The umask is not simply subtracted, but is processed bitwise. Bits set in the umask are cleared in the resulting file mode. umask can be set with either Octal or Symbolic values: \u2022 Octal (Numeric) Value - Represented by either three or four digits. ie umask 0027 or umask 027. If a four digit umask is used, the first digit is ignored. The remaining three digits effect the resulting permissions for user, group, and world/other respectively. \u2022 Symbolic Value - Represented by a comma separated list for User u, group g, and world/other o. The permissions listed are not masked by umask. ie a umask set by umask u=rwx,g=rx,o= is the Symbolic equivalent of the Octal umask 027. This umask would set a newly created directory with file mode drwxr-x--- and a newly created file with file mode rw-r-----. The default umask can be set to use the pam_umask module or in a System Wide Shell Configuration File. The user creating the directories or files has the discretion of changing the permissions via the chmod command, or choosing a different default umask by adding the umask command into a User Shell Configuration File, ( .bash_profile or .bashrc), in their home directory.   Setting the default umask: \u2022 pam_umask module: o will set the umask according to the system default in /etc/login.defs and user settings, solving the problem of different umask settings with different shells, display managers, remote sessions etc. o umask=<mask> value in the /etc/login.defs file is interpreted as Octal o Setting USERGROUPS_ENAB to yes in /etc/login.defs (default): \u25aa will enable setting of the umask group bits to be the same as owner bits. (examples: 022 -> 002, 077 -> 007) for non-root users, if the uid is the same as gid, and username is the same as the <primary group name> \u25aa userdel will remove the user's group if it contains no more members, and useradd will create by default a group with the name of the user \u2022 System Wide Shell Configuration File: o /etc/profile - used to set system wide environmental variables on users shells.

While tracking mount commands gives the system administrator evidence that external media may have been mounted (based on a review of the source of the mount and confirming it's an external media type), it does not conclusively indicate that data was exported to the media. System administrators who wish to determine if data were exported, would also have to track successful open, creat and truncate system calls requiring write access to a file under the mount point of the external media file system. This could give a fair indication that a write occurred. The only way to truly prove it, would be to track successful writes to the external media. Tracking write system calls could quickly fill up the audit log and is not recommended. Recommendations on configuration options to track data export to media is beyond the scope of this document.",

The -V option can be used to verify a particular package or to verify all system packages. If no output is returned, the package is installed correctly. The following table describes the meaning of output from the verify option: Code   Meaning S      File size differs. M      File mode differs (includes permissions and file type). 5      digest (formerly MD5 sum) differs. D      Device file major/minor number mismatch. L      readLink(2) path mismatch. U      User ownership differs. G      Group ownership differs. T      The file time (mtime) differs. P      Capabilities differ. The rpm -qf command can be used to determine which package a particular file belongs to. For example, the following commands determines which package the /bin/bash file belongs to: # rpm -qf /bin/bash bash-4.4.19-2.fc28.x86_64 To verify the settings for the package that controls the /bin/bash file, run the following: # rpm -V bash-4.4.19-2.fc28.x86_64 .M.......    /bin/bash # rpm --verify bash ??5?????? c /etc/bash.bashrc Note that you can feed the output of the rpm -qf command to the rpm -V command: # rpm -V `rpm -qf /etc/passwd` .M...... c /etc/passwd S.5....T c /etc/printcap The rpm -qi command can be used to display package information, including name, version, and description.
