    "description": "Data from journald may be stored in volatile memory or persisted locally on the server. Utilities exist to accept remote export of journald logs, however, use of the rsyslog service provides a consistent means of log collection and export. Notes:  This recommendation assumes that recommendation 4.2.1.5, \"Ensure rsyslog is configured to send logs to a remote log host\" has been implemented.  The main configuration file /etc/systemd/journald.conf is read before any of the custom *.conf files. If there are custom configs present, they override the main configuration parameters  As noted in the journald man pages: journald logs may be exported to rsyslog either through the process mentioned here, or through a facility like systemd- journald.service. There are trade-offs involved in each implementation, where ForwardToSyslog will immediately capture all events (and forward to an external log server, if properly configured), but may not capture all boot-up activities. Mechanisms such as systemd-journald.service, on the other hand, will record bootup events, but may delay sending the information to rsyslog, leading to the potential for log manipulation prior to export. Be aware of the limitations of all tools employed to secure a system.",

Some environments may continue using the pam_tally2.so module, where this older method may simplify automation in mixed environments. Set the lockout number in deny= to the policy in effect at your site. unlock_time=_n_ is the number of seconds the account remains locked after the number of attempts configured in deny=_n_ has been met. Notes:  Additional module options may be set, recommendation only covers those listed here.  When modifying authentication configuration using the authconfig utility, the system- auth and password-auth files are overwritten with the settings from the authconfig utility. This can be avoided by creating symbolic links in place of the configuration files, which authconfig recognizes and does not overwrite. These symbolic links are the default for Fedora 19 derived distributions.  Use of the \"audit\" keyword may log credentials in the case of user error during authentication. This risk should be evaluated in the context of the site policies of your organization.  If a user has been locked out because they have reached the maximum consecutive failure count defined by deny= in the pam_faillock.so or the pam_tally2.so module, the user can be unlocked by issuing following commands. This command sets the failed count to 0, effectively unlocking the user. o If pam_faillock.so is used:  # faillock --user <username> --reset o If pam_tally2.so is used:  # pam_tally2 -u <username> --reset  436 | P a g e",

In Linux, the default permissions for any newly created directory is 0777 (rwxrwxrwx), and for any newly created file it is 0666 (rw-rw-rw-). The umask modifies the default Linux permissions by restricting (masking) these permissions. The umask is not simply subtracted, but is processed bitwise. Bits set in the umask are cleared in the resulting file mode. umask can be set with either octal or Symbolic values  Octal (Numeric) Value - Represented by either three or four digits. ie umask 0027 or umask 027. If a four digit umask is used, the first digit is ignored. The remaining three digits effect the resulting permissions for user, group, and world/other respectively.  Symbolic Value - Represented by a comma separated list for User u, group g, and world/other o. The permissions listed are not masked by umask. ie a umask set by umask u=rwx,g=rx,o= is the Symbolic equivalent of the Octal umask 027. This umask would set a newly created directory with file mode drwxr-x--- and a newly created file with file mode rw-r-----. The default umask is set in a System Wide Shell Configuration File.
