    "title": "Ensure /tmp is a separate partition",
    "assessment": "Automated",
    "description": "The /tmp directory is a world-writable directory used for temporary storage by all users and some applications. - IF - an entry for /tmp exists in /etc/fstab it will take precedence over entries in systemd default unit file. Note: In an environment where the main system is diskless and connected to iSCSI, entries in /etc/fstab may not take precedence. /tmp can be configured to use tmpfs. tmpfs puts everything into the kernel internal caches and grows and shrinks to accommodate the files it contains and is able to swap unneeded pages out to swap space. It has maximum size limits which can be adjusted on the fly via mount -o remount. Since tmpfs lives completely in the page cache and on swap, all tmpfs pages will be shown as \"Shmem\" in /proc/meminfo and \"Shared\" in free. Notice that these counters also include shared memory. The most reliable way to get the count is using df and du. tmpfs has three mount options for sizing: • size: The limit of allocated bytes for this tmpfs instance. The default is half of your physical RAM without swap. If you oversize your tmpfs instances the machine will deadlock since the OOM handler will not be able to free that memory. • nr_blocks: The same as size, but in blocks of PAGE_SIZE. • nr_inodes: The maximum number of inodes for this instance. The default is half of the number of your physical RAM pages, or (on a machine with highmem) the number of lowmem RAM pages, whichever is the lower. These parameters accept a suffix k, m or g and can be changed on remount. The size parameter also accepts a suffix % to limit this tmpfs instance to that percentage of your physical RAM. The default, when neither size nor nr_blocks is specified, is size=50%.",
    "rationale": "Making /tmp its own file system allows an administrator to set additional mount options such as the noexec option on the mount, making /tmp useless for an attacker to install executable code. It would also prevent an attacker from establishing a hard link to a system setuid program and wait for it to be updated. Once the program was updated, the hard link would be broken, and the attacker would have his own copy of the program. If the program happened to have a security vulnerability, the attacker could continue to exploit the known flaw. This can be accomplished by either mounting tmpfs to /tmp, or creating a separate partition for /tmp.

    "description": "SELinux can run in one of three modes: disabled, permissive, or enforcing: • Enforcing - Is the default, and recommended, mode of operation; in enforcing mode SELinux operates normally, enforcing the loaded security policy on the entire system. • Permissive - The system acts as if SELinux is enforcing the loaded security policy, including labeling objects and emitting access denial entries in the logs, but it does not actually deny any operations. While not recommended for production systems, permissive mode can be helpful for SELinux policy development. • Disabled - Is strongly discouraged; not only does the system avoid enforcing the SELinux policy, it also avoids labeling any persistent objects such as files, making it difficult to enable SELinux in the future Note: You can set individual domains to permissive mode while the system runs in enforcing mode. For example, to make the httpd_t domain permissive: # semanage permissive -a httpd_t",

Processes running in unconfined domains fall back to using DAC rules exclusively.

RPC processes notify rpcbind when they start, registering the ports they are listening on and the RPC program numbers they expect to serve. The client system then contacts rpcbind on the server with a particular RPC program number. The rpcbind.service redirects the client to the proper port number so it can communicate with the requested service. Portmapper is an RPC service, which always listens on tcp and udp 111, and is used to map other RPC services (such as nfs, nlockmgr, quotad, mountd, etc.) to their corresponding port number on the server.

Each user can have their own crontab, and though these are files in /var/spool/cron/crontabs, they are not intended to be edited directly.

If the /etc/cron.allow file does not exist but the /etc/cron.deny file does exist, then you must not be listed in the /etc/cron.deny file in order to use this command. If neither of these files exists, then depending on site-dependent configuration parameters, only the super user will be allowed to use this command, or all users will be able to use this command. If both files exist then /etc/cron.allow takes precedence. Which means that /etc/cron.deny is not considered and your user must be listed in /etc/cron.allow in order to be able to use the crontab. Regardless of the existence of any of these files, the root administrative user is always allowed to setup a crontab. The files /etc/cron.allow and /etc/cron.deny, if they exist, must be either world- readable, or readable by group crontab. If they are not, then cron will deny access to all users until the permissions are fixed. There is one file for each user's crontab under the /var/spool/cron/crontabs directory. Users are not allowed to edit the files under that directory directly to ensure that only users allowed by the system to run periodic tasks can add them, and only syntactically correct crontabs will be written there. This is enforced by having the directory writable only by the crontab group and configuring crontab command with the setgid bid set for that specific group.

SYN cookies work by not using the SYN queue at all. Instead, the kernel simply replies to the SYN with a SYN/ACK, but will include a specially crafted TCP sequence number that encodes the source and destination IP address and port number and the time the packet was sent. A legitimate connection would send the ACK packet of the three way handshake with the specially crafted sequence number. This allows the system to verify that it has received a valid response to a SYN cookie and allow the connection, even though there is no corresponding SYN in the queue.",

Proper firewall configurations ensure that only legitimate traffic gets processed, reducing the system’s exposure to potential threats. The choice between FirewallD and NFTables depends on organizational specific needs: FirewallD - Is a firewall service daemon that provides a dynamic customizable host- based firewall with a D-Bus interface. Being dynamic, it enables creating, changing, and deleting the rules without the necessity to restart the firewall daemon each time the rules are changed. NFTables - Includes the nft utility for configuration of the nftables subsystem of the Linux kernel. Notes: • firewalld with nftables backend does not support passing custom nftables rules to firewalld, using the --direct option. • In order to configure firewall rules for nftables, a firewall utility needs to be installed and active of the system. The use of more than one firewall utility may produce unexpected results. • Allow port 22(ssh) needs to be updated to only allow systems requiring ssh connectivity to connect, as per site policy.",

    "assessment": "Automated",
    "description": "Note: To clarify, the two settings described below are only meant for idle connections from a protocol perspective and are not meant to check if the user is active or not. An idle user does not mean an idle connection. SSH does not and never had, intentionally, the capability to drop idle users. In SSH versions before 8.2p1 there was a bug that caused these values to behave in such a manner that they were abused to disconnect idle users. This bug has been resolved in 8.2p1 and thus it can no longer be abused disconnect idle users. The two options ClientAliveInterval and ClientAliveCountMax control the timeout of SSH sessions. Taken directly from man 5 sshd_config: • ClientAliveInterval Sets a timeout interval in seconds after which if no data has been received from the client, sshd(8) will send a message through the encrypted channel to request a response from the client. The default is 0, indicating that these messages will not be sent to the client. • ClientAliveCountMax Sets the number of client alive messages which may be sent without sshd(8) receiving any messages back from the client. If this threshold is reached while client alive messages are being sent, sshd will disconnect the client, terminating the session. It is important to note that the use of client alive messages is very different from TCPKeepAlive. The client alive messages are sent through the encrypted channel and therefore will not be spoofable. The TCP keepalive option en‐abled by TCPKeepAlive is spoofable. The client alive mechanism is valuable when the client or server depend on knowing when a connection has become unresponsive. The default value is 3. If ClientAliveInterval is set to 15, and ClientAliveCountMax is left at the default, unresponsive SSH clients will be disconnected after approximately 45 seconds. Setting a zero ClientAliveCountMax disables connection termination.",
    "rationale": "In order to prevent resource exhaustion, appropriate values should be set for both ClientAliveInterval and ClientAliveCountMax. Specifically, looking at the source code, ClientAliveCountMax must be greater than zero in order to utilize the ability of SSH to drop idle connections.

This option overrides all other forwarding-related options and may simplify restricted configurations. • X11Forwarding provides the ability to tunnel X11 traffic through the connection to enable remote graphic connections. • ssh-agent is a program to hold private keys used for public key authentication. Through use of environment variables the agent can be located and automatically used for authentication when logging in to other machines using ssh. • SSH port forwarding is a mechanism in SSH for tunneling application ports from the client to the server, or servers to clients. It can be used for adding encryption to legacy applications, going through firewalls, and some system administrators and IT professionals use it for opening backdoors into the internal network from their home machines.",

There is a small risk that the remote X11 servers of users who are logged in via SSH with X11 forwarding could be compromised by other users on the X11 server. Note that even if X11 forwarding is disabled, users can always install their own forwarders. anyone with root privilege on the the intermediate server can make free use of ssh- agent to authenticate them to other servers Leaving port forwarding enabled can expose the organization to security risks and backdoors. SSH connections are protected with strong encryption. This makes their contents invisible to most deployed network monitoring and traffic filtering solutions. This invisibility carries considerable risk potential if it is used for malicious purposes such as data exfiltration. Cybercriminals or malware could exploit SSH to hide their unauthorized communications, or to exfiltrate stolen data from the target network. Impact: SSH tunnels are widely used in many corporate environments. In some environments the applications themselves may have very limited native support for security.

Authselect offers ready-made profiles that can be universally used with all modern identity management systems Authselect makes testing and troubleshooting easy because it only modifies files in these directories: • /etc/nsswitch.conf • /etc/pam.d/* files • /etc/dconf/db/distro.d/* files You can create and deploy a custom profile by customizing one of the default profiles, the sssd, winbind, or the nis profile. This is particularly useful if Modifying a ready-made authselect profile is not enough for your needs. When you deploy a custom profile, the profile is applied to every user logging into the given host. This would be the recommended method, so that the existing profiles can remain unmodified. Profile Directories - Profiles can be found in one of three directories: • /usr/share/authselect/default - Read-only directory containing profiles shipped together with authselect. • /usr/share/authselect/vendor - Read-only directory for vendor-specific profiles that can override the ones in default directory. • /etc/authselect/custom - Place for administrator-defined profiles. Profile Files - Each profile consists of one or more of these files which provide a mandatory profile description and describe the changes that are done to the system: • README - Description of the profile. The first line must be a name of the profile. • system-auth - PAM stack that is included from nearly all individual service configuration files. • password-auth, smartcard-auth, fingerprint-auth - These PAM stacks are for applications which handle authentication from different types of devices via simultaneously running individual conversations instead of one aggregate conversation. • postlogin - The purpose of this PAM stack is to provide a common place for all PAM modules which should be called after the stack configured in system-auth or the other common PAM configuration files. It is included from all individual service configuration files that provide login service with shell or file access. Note: the modules in the postlogin configuration file are executed regardless of the success or failure of the modules in the system-auth configuration file. • nsswitch.conf - Name Service Switch configuration file. Only maps relevant to the profile must be set. Maps that are not specified by the profile are included from /etc/authselect/user-nsswitch.conf. • dconf-db - Changes to dconf database. The main uses case of this file is to set changes for gnome login screen in order to enable or disable smartcard and fingerprint authentication. • dconf-locks - This file define locks on values set in dconf database. Conditional lines - Each of these files serves as a template. A template is a plain text file with optional usage of several operators that can be used to provide some optional profile features. • {continue if \"feature\"} - Immediately stop processing of the file unless \"feature\" is defined (the rest of the file content will be removed). If \"feature\" is defined, the whole line with this operator will be removed and the rest of the template will be processed. • {stop if \"feature\"} - Opposite of \"continue if\". Immediately stop processing of the file if \"feature\" is defined (the rest of the file content will be removed). If \"feature\" is not defined, the whole line with this operator will be removed and the rest of the template will be processed. • {include if \"feature\"} - Include the line where this operator is placed only if \"feature\" is defined. • {exclude if \"feature\"} - Opposite to \"include-if\". Include the line where this operator is placed only if \"feature\" is not defined. • {imply \"implied-feature\" if \"feature\"} - Enable feature \"implied-feature\" if feature \"feature\" is enabled. The whole line with this operator is removed, thus it is not possible to add anything else around this operator at the same line. • {if \"feature\":true|false} - If \"feature\" is defined, replace this operator with string \"true\", otherwise with string \"false\". • {if \"feature\":true} - If \"feature\" is defined, replace this operator with string \"true\", otherwise with an empty string.

These arguments allow the PAM configuration files for particular programs to use a common PAM module but in different ways. Invalid arguments are ignored and do not otherwise affect the success or failure of the PAM module. When an invalid argument is passed, an error is usually written to /var/log/messages file. However, since the reporting method is controlled by the PAM module, the module must be written correctly to log the error to this file. 5.3.3.1 Configure pam_faillock module faillock.conf provides a way to configure the default settings for locking the user after multiple failed authentication attempts. This file is read by the pam_faillock module and is the preferred method over configuring pam_faillock directly. The file has a very simple name = value format with possible comments starting with # character. The whitespace at the beginning of line, end of line, and around the = sign is ignored. Options: • <dir=/path/to/tally-directory> - The directory where the user files with the failure records are kept. The default is /var/run/faillock. Note: These files will disappear after reboot on systems configured with directory /var/run/faillock mounted on virtual memory. • audit - Will log the user name into the system log if the user is not found. • silent - Don't print informative messages to the user. Please note that when this option is not used there will be difference in the authentication behavior for users which exist on the system and non-existing users. • no_log_info - Don't log informative messages via syslog(3). • local_users_only - Only track failed user authentications attempts for local users in /etc/passwd and ignore centralized (AD, IdM, LDAP, etc.) users. The faillock(8) command will also no longer track user failed authentication attempts. Enabling this option will prevent a double-lockout scenario where a user is locked out locally and in the centralized mechanism. • nodelay - Don't enforce a delay after authentication failures. • deny=<n> - Deny access if the number of consecutive authentication failures for this user during the recent interval exceeds . The default is 3. • fail_interval=n - The length of the interval during which the consecutive authentication failures must happen for the user account lock out is n seconds. The default is 900 (15 minutes). • unlock_time=n - The access will be re-enabled after n seconds after the lock out. The value 0 has the same meaning as value never - the access will not be re-enabled without resetting the faillock entries by the faillock(8) command. The default is 600 (10 minutes). Note that the default directory that pam_faillock uses is usually cleared on system boot so the access will be also re-enabled after system reboot. If that is undesirable a different tally directory must be set with the dir option. Also note that it is usually undesirable to permanently lock out users as they can become easily a target of denial of service attack unless the usernames are random and kept secret to potential attackers. • even_deny_root - Root account can become locked as well as regular accounts. • root_unlock_time=n - This option implies even_deny_root option. Allow access after n seconds to root account after the account is locked. In case the option is not specified the value is the same as of the unlock_time option. • admin_group=name - If a group name is specified with this option, members of the group will be handled by this module the same as the root account (the options even_deny_root and root_unlock_time will apply to them. By default the option is not set. Example /etc/security/faillock.conf file: deny=5 unlock_time=900 even_deny_root",

    "rationale": "The window of opportunity for an attacker to leverage compromised credentials or successfully compromise credentials via an online brute force attack is limited by the age of the password. Therefore, reducing the maximum age of a password also reduces an attacker's window of opportunity. We recommend a yearly password change. This is primarily because for all their good intentions users will share credentials across accounts. Therefore, even if a breach is publicly identified, the user may not see this notification, or forget they have an account on that site. This could leave a shared credential vulnerable indefinitely. Having an organizational policy of a 1-year (annual) password expiration is a reasonable compromise to mitigate this with minimal user burden.  Impact: The password expiration must be greater than the minimum days between password changes or users will be unable to change their password. Excessive password expiration requirements do more harm than good, because these requirements make users select predictable passwords, composed of sequential words and numbers that are closely related to each other. In these cases, the next password can be predicted based on the previous one (incrementing a number used in the password for example). Also, password expiration requirements offer no containment benefits because attackers will often use credentials as soon as they compromise them. Instead, immediate password changes should be based on key events including, but not limited to: • Indication of compromise • Change of user roles • When a user leaves the organization.

In Linux, the default permissions for any newly created directory is 0777 (rwxrwxrwx), and for any newly created file it is 0666 (rw-rw- rw-). The umask modifies the default Linux permissions by restricting (masking) these permissions. The umask is not simply subtracted, but is processed bitwise. Bits set in the umask are cleared in the resulting file mode. umask can be set with either Octal or Symbolic values: • Octal (Numeric) Value - Represented by either three or four digits. ie umask 0027 or umask 027. If a four digit umask is used, the first digit is ignored. The remaining three digits effect the resulting permissions for user, group, and world/other respectively. • Symbolic Value - Represented by a comma separated list for User u, group g, and world/other o. The permissions listed are not masked by umask. ie a umask set by umask u=rwx,g=rx,o= is the Symbolic equivalent of the Octal umask 027. This umask would set a newly created directory with file mode drwxr-x--- and a newly created file with file mode rw-r-----. The default umask can be set to use the pam_umask module or in a System Wide Shell Configuration File. The user creating the directories or files has the discretion of changing the permissions via the chmod command, or choosing a different default umask by adding the umask command into a User Shell Configuration File, ( .bash_profile or .bashrc), in their home directory.  Setting the default umask: • pam_umask module: o will set the umask according to the system default in /etc/login.defs and user settings, solving the problem of different umask settings with different shells, display managers, remote sessions etc. o umask=<mask> value in the /etc/login.defs file is interpreted as Octal o Setting USERGROUPS_ENAB to yes in /etc/login.defs (default): ▪ will enable setting of the umask group bits to be the same as owner bits. (examples: 022 -> 002, 077 -> 007) for non-root users, if the uid is the same as gid, and username is the same as the <primary group name> ▪ userdel will remove the user's group if it contains no more members, and useradd will create by default a group with the name of the user • System Wide Shell Configuration File: o /etc/profile - used to set system wide environmental variables on users shells.

System administrators who wish to determine if data were exported, would also have to track successful open, creat and truncate system calls requiring write access to a file under the mount point of the external media file system. This could give a fair indication that a write occurred. The only way to truly prove it, would be to track successful writes to the external media.

    "rationale": "The /etc/passwd file also contains information like user ID's and group ID's that are used by many system programs. Therefore, the /etc/passwd file must remain world readable. In spite of encoding the password with a randomly-generated one-way hash function, an attacker could still break the system if they got access to the /etc/passwd file. This can be mitigated by using shadowed passwords, thus moving the passwords in the /etc/passwd file to /etc/shadow. The /etc/shadow file is set so only root will be able to read and write. This helps mitigate the risk of an attacker gaining access to the encoded passwords with which to perform a dictionary attack. Note: • All accounts must have passwords or be locked to prevent the account from being used by an unauthorized user. • A user account with an empty second field in /etc/passwd allows the account to be logged into by providing only the username.",
