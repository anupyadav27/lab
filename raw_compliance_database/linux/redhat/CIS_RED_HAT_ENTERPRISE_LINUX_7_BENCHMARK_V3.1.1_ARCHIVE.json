This assignment happens before the interface is used. The configuration of the connection can either be the NetworkManager configuration or also an ifcfg. Example: If the zone is not set in the configuration file, the interfaces will be assigned to the default zone defined in the firewalld configuration.

The umask modifies the default Linux permissions by restricting (masking) these permissions. The umask is not simply subtracted, but is processed bitwise. Bits set in the umask are cleared in the resulting file mode. umask can be set with either octal or Symbolic values: \uf0b7 Octal (Numeric) Value - Represented by either three or four digits. ie umask 0027 or umask 027. If a four digit umask is used, the first digit is ignored.

The V option can be used to verify a particular package or to verify all system packages. If no output is returned, the package is installed correctly. The following table describes the meaning of output from the verify option: Code   Meaning S      File size differs. M      File mode differs (includes permissions and file type). 5      The MD5 checksum differs. D      The major and minor version numbers differ on a device file. L      A mismatch occurs in a link. U      The file ownership differs. G      The file group owner differs. T      The file time (mtime) differs. The rpm -qf command can be used to determine which package a particular file belongs to. For example the following commands determines which package the /etc/ssh/sshd_config file belongs to: # rpm -qf /etc/ssh/sshd_config openssh-server-7.4p1-21.el7.x86_64 To verify the settings for the package that controls the /bin/bash file, run the following: # rpm -V openssh-server-7.4p1-21.el7.x86_64 S.5....T.  c /etc/ssh/sshd_config Note: You can feed the output of the rpm -qf command to the rpm -V command: #  rpm -V $(rpm -qf /etc/ssh/sshd_config) S.5....T.  c /etc/ssh/sshd_config  551 | P a g e Notes: \uf0b7 Since packages and important files may change with new updates and releases, it is recommended to verify everything, not just a finite list of files.
