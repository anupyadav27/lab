Alter the frequency and time of the checks in compliance with site policy. 1.4 Configure SELinux SELinux provides a Mandatory Access Control (MAC) system that greatly augments the default Discretionary Access Control (DAC) model. Under SELinux, every process and every object (files, sockets, pipes) on the system is assigned a security context, a label that includes detailed type information about the object. The kernel allows processes to access objects only if that access is explicitly allowed by the policy in effect. The policy defines transitions, so that a user can be allowed to run software, but the software can run under a different context than the user's default. This automatically limits the damage that the software can do to files accessible by the calling user. The user does not need to take any action to gain this benefit. For an action to occur, both the traditional DAC permissions must be satisfied as well as the SELinux MAC rules. The action will not be allowed if either one of these models does not permit the action. In this way, SELinux rules can only make a system's permissions more restrictive and secure. SELinux requires a complex policy to allow all the actions required of a system under normal operation. Three such policies have been designed for use with RHEL7 and are included with the system: targeted, strict, and mls. These are described as follows: \uf0b7 targeted: consists mostly of Type Enforcement (TE) rules, and a small number of Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) rules. Targeted restricts the actions of many types of programs, but leaves interactive users largely unaffected. \uf0b7 strict: also uses TE and RBAC rules, but on more programs and more aggressively. \uf0b7 mls: implements Multi-Level Security (MLS), which introduces even more kinds of labels (sensitivity and category) and rules that govern access based on these. This section provides guidance for the configuration of the targeted policy. References: 1.

This prevents the exploitation of vulnerabilities discovered at a later date. If a service is not enabled, it cannot be exploited.  The actions in this section of the document provide guidance on what services can be safely disabled and under which circumstances, greatly reducing the number of possible threats to the resulting system. 2.1 Remove Legacy Services The items in this section are intended to ensure that legacy services are not installed on the system. Some guidance includes directives to both disable and remove the service. There is no good reason to have these services on the system, even in a disabled state. Note: The audit items in the section check to see if the packages are listed in the yum database and installed using rpm. It could be argued that someone may have installed them separately. However, this is also true for any other type of rogue software.

It is recommended that rsyslog be used for logging (with logwatch providing summarization) and auditd be used for auditing (with aureport providing summarization) to automatically monitor logs for intrusion attempts and other suspicious system behavior. In addition to the local log files created by the steps in this section, it is also recommended that sites collect copies of their system logs on a secure, centralized log server via an encrypted connection. Not only does centralized logging help sites correlate events that may be occurring on multiple systems, but having a second copy of the system log information may be critical after a system compromise where the attacker has modified the local log files on the affected system(s). If a log correlation system is deployed, configure it to process the logs described in this section. Because it is often necessary to correlate log information from many different systems (particularly after a security incident) it is recommended that the time be synchronized among systems and devices connected to the local network. The standard Internet protocol for time synchronization is the Network Time Protocol (NTP), which is supported by most network-ready devices. See the ntpd(8) manual page for more information on configuring NTP. It is important that all logs described in this section be monitored on a regular basis and correlated to determine trends. A seemingly innocuous entry in one log could be more significant when compared to an entry in another log. Note on log file permissions: There really isn't a \"one size fits all\" solution to the permissions on log files. Many sites utilize group permissions so that administrators who are in a defined security group, such as \"wheel\" do not have to elevate privileges to root in order to read log files. Also, if a third party log aggregation tool is used, it may need to have group permissions to read the log files, which is preferable to having it run setuid to root. 84 | P a g e Therefore, there are two remediation and audit steps for log file permissions. One is for systems that do not have a secured group method implemented that only permits root to read the log files (root:root 600). The other is for sites that do have such a setup and are designated as root:securegrp 640 where securegrp is the defined security group (in some cases wheel). 5.1 Configure rsyslog The rsyslog software is recommended as a replacement for the default syslogd daemon and provides improvements over syslogd, such as connection-oriented (i.e. TCP) transmission of logs, the option to log to database formats, and the encryption of log data en route to a central logging server.",

By default, auditd will audit SELinux AVC denials, system logins, account modifications, and authentication events. Events will be logged to /var/log/audit/audit.log. The recording of these events will use a modest amount of disk space on a system. If significantly more events are captured, additional on system or off system storage may need to be allocated. Note: For 64 bit systems that have arch as a rule parameter, you will need two rules: one for 64 bit and one for 32 bit systems. For 32 bit systems, only one rule is needed. 5.2.1 Configure Data Retention When auditing, it is important to carefully configure the storage requirements for audit logs. By default, auditd will max out the log files at 5MB and retain only 4 copies of them. Older versions will be deleted. It is possible on a system that the 20 MBs of audit logs may fill up the system causing loss of audit data.

    "references": "1. See the rsyslog(8) man page for more information. 5.2 Configure System Accounting (auditd) System auditing, through auditd, allows system administrators to monitor their systems such that they can detect unauthorized access or modification of data. By default, auditd will audit SELinux AVC denials, system logins, account modifications, and authentication events. Events will be logged to /var/log/audit/audit.log. The recording of these events will use a modest amount of disk space on a system. If significantly more events are captured, additional on system or off system storage may need to be allocated. Note: For 64 bit systems that have arch as a rule parameter, you will need two rules: one for 64 bit and one for 32 bit systems. For 32 bit systems, only one rule is needed. 5.2.1 Configure Data Retention When auditing, it is important to carefully configure the storage requirements for audit logs. By default, auditd will max out the log files at 5MB and retain only 4 copies of them. Older versions will be deleted. It is possible on a system that the 20 MBs of audit logs may fill up the system causing loss of audit data. While the recommendations here provide guidance, check your site policy for audit storage requirements."
