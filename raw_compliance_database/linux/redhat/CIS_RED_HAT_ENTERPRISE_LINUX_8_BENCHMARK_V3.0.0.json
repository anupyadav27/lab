    "title": "Ensure /tmp is a separate partition",
    "assessment": "Automated",
    "description": "The /tmp directory is a world-writable directory used for temporary storage by all users and some applications. -IF- an entry for /tmp exists in /etc/fstab it will take precedence over entries in systemd default unit file. Note: In an environment where the main system is diskless and connected to iSCSI, entries in /etc/fstab may not take precedence. /tmp can be configured to use tmpfs. tmpfs puts everything into the kernel internal caches and grows and shrinks to accommodate the files it contains and is able to swap unneeded pages out to swap space. It has maximum size limits which can be adjusted on the fly via mount -o remount. Since tmpfs lives completely in the page cache and on swap, all tmpfs pages will be shown as \"Shmem\" in /proc/meminfo and \"Shared\" in free. Notice that these counters also include shared memory. The most reliable way to get the count is using df and du. tmpfs has three mount options for sizing: \u2022 size: The limit of allocated bytes for this tmpfs instance. The default is half of your physical RAM without swap. If you oversize your tmpfs instances the machine will deadlock since the OOM handler will not be able to free that memory. \u2022 nr_blocks: The same as size, but in blocks of PAGE_SIZE. \u2022 nr_inodes: The maximum number of inodes for this instance. The default is half of the number of your physical RAM pages, or (on a machine with highmem) the number of lowmem RAM pages, whichever is the lower. These parameters accept a suffix k, m or g and can be changed on remount. The size parameter also accepts a suffix % to limit this tmpfs instance to that percentage of your physical RAM. The default, when neither size nor nr_blocks is specified, is size=50%.",
    "rationale": "Making /tmp its own file system allows an administrator to set additional mount options such as the noexec option on the mount, making /tmp useless for an attacker to install executable code. It would also prevent an attacker from establishing a hard link to a system setuid program and wait for it to be updated. Once the program was updated, the hard link would be broken and the attacker would have his own copy of the program. If the program happened to have a security vulnerability, the attacker could continue to exploit the known flaw. This can be accomplished by either mounting tmpfs to /tmp, or creating a separate partition for /tmp. Impact: By design files saved to /tmp should have no expectation of surviving a reboot of the system. tmpfs is ram based and all files stored to tmpfs will be lost when the system is rebooted. If files need to be persistent through a reboot, they should be saved to /var/tmp not /tmp. Since the /tmp directory is intended to be world-writable, there is a risk of resource exhaustion if it is not bound to tmpfs or a separate partition. Running out of /tmp space is a problem regardless of what kind of filesystem lies under it, but in a configuration where /tmp is not a separate file system it will essentially have the whole disk available, as the default installation only creates a single / partition. On the other hand, a RAM-based /tmp (as with tmpfs) will almost certainly be much smaller, which can lead to applications filling up the filesystem much more easily. Another alternative is to create a dedicated partition for /tmp from a separate volume or disk. One of the downsides of a disk-based dedicated partition is that it will be slower than tmpfs which is RAM-based.",

By restricting how processes can access files and resources on a system the potential impact from vulnerabilities in the processes can be reduced. Impact: Mandatory Access Control limits the capabilities of applications and daemons on a system, while this can prevent unauthorized access the configuration of MAC can be complex and difficult to implement correctly preventing legitimate access from occurring. 1.5.1 Configure SELinux SELinux implements Mandatory Access Control (MAC). Every process and system resource has a special security label called an SELinux context. A SELinux context, sometimes referred to as an SELinux label, is an identifier which abstracts away the system-level details and focuses on the security properties of the entity. Not only does this provide a consistent way of referencing objects in the SELinux policy, but it also removes any ambiguity that can be found in other identification methods. For example, a file can have multiple valid path names on a system that makes use of bind mounts. The SELinux policy uses these contexts in a series of rules which define how processes can interact with each other and the various system resources. By default, the policy does not allow any interaction unless a rule explicitly grants access. In Fedora 28 Family Linux distributions, system services are controlled by the systemd daemon; systemd starts and stops all services, and users and processes communicate with systemd using the systemctl utility. The systemd daemon can consult the SELinux policy and check the label of the calling process and the label of the unit file that the caller tries to manage, and then ask SELinux whether or not the caller is allowed the access. This approach strengthens access control to critical system capabilities, which include starting and stopping system services. This automatically limits the damage that the software can do to files accessible by the calling user. The user does not need to take any action to gain this benefit. For an action to occur, both the traditional DAC permissions must be satisfied as well as the SELinux MAC rules. The action will not be allowed if either one of these models does not permit the action. In this way, SELinux rules can only make a system's permissions more restrictive and secure. SELinux requires a complex policy to allow all the actions required of a system under normal operation. Two such policies have been designed for use with Fedora 28 Family Linux distributions and are included with the system: \u2022 targeted - Targeted processes run in their own domain, called a confined domain. In a confined domain, the files that a targeted process has access to are limited. If a confined process is compromised by an attacker, the attacker\u2019s access to resources and the possible damage they can do is also limited. SELinux denies access to these resources and logs the denial. \u2022 mls - Implements Multi-Level Security (MLS), which introduces even more kinds of labels (sensitivity and category) and rules that govern access based on these. This section provides guidance for the configuration of the targeted policy.  Note: \u2022 Remember that SELinux policy rules are checked after DAC rules. SELinux policy rules are not used if DAC rules deny access first, which means that no SELinux denial is logged if the traditional DAC rules prevent the access. \u2022 This section only applies if SELinux is in use on the system. Additional Mandatory Access Control systems exist. \u2022 To avoid incorrect SELinux labeling and subsequent problems, ensure that you start services using a systemctl start command.

    "description": "Message Authentication Code (MAC) algorithm is a family of cryptographic functions that is parameterized by a symmetric key. Each of the functions can act on input data (called a \u201cmessage\u201d) of variable length to produce an output value of a specified length. The output value is called the MAC of the input message. A MAC algorithm can be used to provide data-origin authentication and data-integrity protection",
    "rationale": "Weak algorithms continue to have a great deal of attention as a weak spot that can be exploited with expanded computing power. An attacker that breaks the algorithm could take advantage of a MiTM position to decrypt the tunnel and capture credentials and information. A MAC algorithm must be computationally infeasible to determine the MAC of a message without knowledge of the key, even if one has already seen the results of using that key to compute the MAC's of other messages.",

    "description": "crontab is the program used to install, deinstall, or list the tables used to drive the cron daemon. Each user can have their own crontab, and though these are files in /var/spool/cron/crontabs, they are not intended to be edited directly. If the /etc/cron.allow file exists, then you must be listed (one user per line) therein in order to be allowed to use this command. If the /etc/cron.allow file does not exist but the /etc/cron.deny file does exist, then you must not be listed in the /etc/cron.deny file in order to use this command. If neither of these files exists, then depending on site-dependent configuration parameters, only the super user will be allowed to use this command, or all users will be able to use this command. If both files exist then /etc/cron.allow takes precedence. Which means that /etc/cron.deny is not considered and your user must be listed in /etc/cron.allow in order to be able to use the crontab. Regardless of the existence of any of these files, the root administrative user is always allowed to setup a crontab. The files /etc/cron.allow and /etc/cron.deny, if they exist, must be either world- readable, or readable by group crontab. If they are not, then cron will deny access to all users until the permissions are fixed. There is one file for each user's crontab under the /var/spool/cron/crontabs directory. Users are not allowed to edit the files under that directory directly to ensure that only users allowed by the system to run periodic tasks can add them, and only syntactically correct crontabs will be written there. This is enforced by having the directory writable only by the crontab group and configuring crontab command with the setgid bid set for that specific group. Note: \u2022 Even though a given user is not listed in cron.allow, cron jobs can still be run as that user \u2022 The files /etc/cron.allow and /etc/cron.deny, if they exist, only controls administrative access to the crontab command for scheduling and modifying cron jobs",

(If that time is already past, the next day is assumed.) You may also specify midnight, noon, or teatime (4pm) and you can have a time-of-day suffixed with AM or PM for running in the morning or the evening. You can also say what day the job will be run, by giving a date in the form month-name day with an optional year, or giving a date of the form MMDD[CC]YY, MM/DD/[CC]YY, DD.MM.[CC]YY or [CC]YY-MM-DD. The specification of a date must follow the specification of the time of day. You can also give times like now + count time-units, where the time-units can be minutes, hours, days, or weeks and you can tell at to run the job today by suffixing the time with today and to run the job tomorrow by suffixing the time with tomorrow. The /etc/at.allow and /etc/at.deny files determine which user can submit commands for later execution via at or batch. The format of the files is a list of usernames, one on each line.

    "assessment": "Automated",
    "description": "Note: To clarify, the two settings described below are only meant for idle connections from a protocol perspective and are not meant to check if the user is active or not. An idle user does not mean an idle connection. SSH does not and never had, intentionally, the capability to drop idle users. In SSH versions before 8.2p1 there was a bug that caused these values to behave in such a manner that they were abused to disconnect idle users. This bug has been resolved in 8.2p1 and thus it can no longer be abused disconnect idle users. The two options ClientAliveInterval and ClientAliveCountMax control the timeout of SSH sessions. Taken directly from man 5 sshd_config: \u2022 ClientAliveInterval Sets a timeout interval in seconds after which if no data has been received from the client, sshd(8) will send a message through the encrypted channel to request a response from the client. The default is 0, indicating that these messages will not be sent to the client. \u2022 ClientAliveCountMax Sets the number of client alive messages which may be sent without sshd(8) receiving any messages back from the client. If this threshold is reached while client alive messages are being sent, sshd will disconnect the client, terminating the session. It is important to note that the use of client alive messages is very different from TCPKeepAlive. The client alive messages are sent through the encrypted channel and therefore will not be spoofable. The TCP keepalive option en\u2010abled by TCPKeepAlive is spoofable. The client alive mechanism is valuable when the client or server depend on knowing when a connection has become unresponsive. The default value is 3. If ClientAliveInterval is set to 15, and ClientAliveCountMax is left at the default, unresponsive SSH clients will be disconnected after approximately 45 seconds. Setting a zero ClientAliveCountMax disables connection termination.",
    "rationale": "In order to prevent resource exhaustion, appropriate values should be set for both ClientAliveInterval and ClientAliveCountMax. Specifically, looking at the source code, ClientAliveCountMax must be greater than zero in order to utilize the ability of SSH to drop idle connections. If connections are allowed to stay open indefinitely, this can potentially be used as a DDOS attack or simple resource exhaustion could occur over unreliable networks. The example set here is a 45 second timeout. Consult your site policy for network timeouts and apply as appropriate.",

The file has a very simple name = value format with possible comments starting with # character. The whitespace at the beginning of line, end of line, and around the = sign is ignored. Options: \u2022 <dir=/path/to/tally-directory> - The directory where the user files with the failure records are kept. The default is /var/run/faillock. Note: These files will disappear after reboot on systems configured with directory /var/run/faillock mounted on virtual memory. \u2022 audit - Will log the user name into the system log if the user is not found. \u2022 silent - Don't print informative messages to the user. Please note that when this option is not used there will be difference in the authentication behavior for users which exist on the system and non-existing users. \u2022 no_log_info - Don't log informative messages via syslog(3). \u2022 local_users_only - Only track failed user authentications attempts for local users in /etc/passwd and ignore centralized (AD, IdM, LDAP, etc.) users. The faillock(8) command will also no longer track user failed authentication attempts. Enabling this option will prevent a double-lockout scenario where a user is locked out locally and in the centralized mechanism. \u2022 nodelay - Don't enforce a delay after authentication failures. \u2022 deny=<n> - Deny access if the number of consecutive authentication failures for this user during the recent interval exceeds . The default is 3. \u2022 fail_interval=n - The length of the interval during which the consecutive authentication failures must happen for the user account lock out is n seconds. The default is 900 (15 minutes). \u2022 unlock_time=n - The access will be re-enabled after n seconds after the lock out. The value 0 has the same meaning as value never - the access will not be re- enabled without resetting the faillock entries by the faillock(8) command. The default is 600 (10 minutes). Note that the default directory that pam_faillock uses is usually cleared on system boot so the access will be also re-enabled after system reboot. If that is undesirable a different tally directory must be set with the dir option. Also note that it is usually undesirable to permanently lock out users as they can become easily a target of denial of service attack unless the usernames are random and kept secret to potential attackers. \u2022 even_deny_root - Root account can become locked as well as regular accounts. \u2022 root_unlock_time=n - This option implies even_deny_root option. Allow access after n seconds to root account after the account is locked. In case the option is not specified the value is the same as of the unlock_time option.  \u2022 admin_group=name - If a group name is specified with this option, members of the group will be handled by this module the same as the root account (the options even_deny_root and root_unlock_time will apply to them. By default the option is not set. Example /etc/security/faillock.conf file: deny=5 unlock_time=900 even_deny_root",

    "description": "The RPM Package Manager has a number of useful options. One of these, the -V for RPM option, can be used to verify that system packages are correctly installed. The -V option can be used to verify a particular package or to verify all system packages. If no output is returned, the package is installed correctly. The following table describes the meaning of output from the verify option: Code   Meaning S      File size differs. M      File mode differs (includes permissions and file type). 5      digest (formerly MD5 sum) differs. D      Device file major/minor number mismatch. L      readLink(2) path mismatch. U      User ownership differs. G      Group ownership differs. T      The file time (mtime) differs. P      Capabilities differ. The rpm -qf command can be used to determine which package a particular file belongs to. For example, the following commands determines which package the /bin/bash file belongs to: # rpm -qf /bin/bash bash-4.4.19-2.fc28.x86_64 To verify the settings for the package that controls the /bin/bash file, run the following: # rpm -V bash-4.4.19-2.fc28.x86_64 .M.......    /bin/bash # rpm --verify bash ??5?????? c /etc/bash.bashrc Note that you can feed the output of the rpm -qf command to the rpm -V command: # rpm -V `rpm -qf /etc/passwd` .M...... c /etc/passwd S.5....T c /etc/printcap  The rpm -qi command can be used to display package information, including name, version, and description. Following example displays information for bash package: # rpm -qi bash Name        : bash Version     : 4.4.19 Release     : 2.fc28 Architecture: x86_64 Install Date: Tue 15 Aug 2023 10:27:28 AM EDT Group       : Unspecified Size        : 6910653 License     : GPLv3+ Signature   : RSA/SHA256, Thu 15 Mar 2018 10:10:10 AM EDT, Key ID e08e7e629db62fb1 Source RPM  : bash-4.4.19-2.fc28.src.rpm Build Date  : Thu 15 Mar 2018 10:01:10 AM EDT Build Host  : buildhw-07.phx2.fedoraproject.org Relocations : (not relocatable) Packager    : Fedora Project Vendor      : Fedora Project URL         : https://www.gnu.org/software/bash Bug URL     : https://bugz.fedoraproject.org/bash Summary     : The GNU Bourne Again shell Description : The GNU Bourne Again shell (Bash) is a shell or command language interpreter that is compatible with the Bourne shell (sh).

In spite of encoding the password with a randomly-generated one-way hash function, an attacker could still break the system if they got access to the /etc/passwd file. This can be mitigated by using shadowed passwords, thus moving the passwords in the /etc/passwd file to /etc/shadow. The /etc/shadow file is set so only root will be able to read and write. This helps mitigate the risk of an attacker gaining access to the encoded passwords with which to perform a dictionary attack.
