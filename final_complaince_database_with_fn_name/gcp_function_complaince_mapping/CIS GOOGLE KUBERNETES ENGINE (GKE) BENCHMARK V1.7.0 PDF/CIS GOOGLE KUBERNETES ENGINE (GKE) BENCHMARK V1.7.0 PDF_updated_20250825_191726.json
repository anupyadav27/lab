    "rationale": "A GCP service account (as distinct from a Kubernetes ServiceAccount) is an identity that an instance or an application can be used to run GCP API requests. This identity is used to identify virtual machine instances to other Google Cloud Platform services. By default, Kubernetes Engine nodes use the Compute Engine default service account. This account has broad access by default, as defined by access scopes, making it useful to a wide variety of applications on the VM, but it has more permissions than are required to run your Kubernetes Engine cluster. A minimally privileged service account should be created and used to run the Kubernetes Engine cluster instead of using the Compute Engine default service account, and create separate service accounts for each Kubernetes Workload (See recommendation 5.2.2). Kubernetes Engine requires, at a minimum, the node service account to have the monitoring.viewer, monitoring.metricWriter, and logging.logWriter roles. Additional roles may need to be added for the nodes to pull images from GCR. Impact: Instances are automatically granted the https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud- platform scope to allow full access to all Google Cloud APIs. This is so that the IAM permissions of the instance are completely determined by the IAM roles of the Service account. Thus if Kubernetes workloads were using cluster access scopes to perform actions using Google APIs, they may no longer be able to, if not permitted by the permissions of the Service account.

    "rationale": "Manual approaches for authenticating Kubernetes workloads running on GKE against Google Cloud APIs are: storing service account keys as a Kubernetes secret (which introduces manual key rotation and potential for key compromise); or use of the underlying nodes' IAM Service account, which violates the principle of least privilege on a multitenanted node, when one pod needs to have access to a service, but every other pod on the node that uses the Service account does not. Once a relationship between a Kubernetes Service account and a GCP Service account has been configured, any workload running as the Kubernetes Service account automatically authenticates as the mapped GCP Service account when accessing Google Cloud APIs on a cluster with Workload Identity enabled.

These versions have passed internal validation, but don't have enough historical data to guarantee their stability. Known issues generally have known workarounds. The Stable release channel upgrades every few months and is for production users who need stability above all else, and for whom frequent upgrades are too risky. These versions have passed internal validation and have been shown to be stable and reliable in production, based on the observed performance of those clusters. Critical security patches are delivered to all release channels. Impact: Once release channels are enabled on a cluster, they cannot be disabled.

You can set this restriction by specifying an authorized network. Control Plane Authorized Networks blocks untrusted IP addresses. Google Cloud Platform IPs (such as traffic from Compute Engine VMs) can reach your master through HTTPS provided that they have the necessary Kubernetes credentials. Restricting access to an authorized network can provide additional security benefits for your container cluster, including: • Better protection from outsider attacks: Authorized networks provide an additional layer of security by limiting external, non-GCP access to a specific set of addresses you designate, such as those that originate from your premises. This helps protect access to your cluster in the case of a vulnerability in the cluster's authentication or authorization mechanism. • Better protection from insider attacks: Authorized networks help protect your cluster from accidental leaks of master certificates from your company's premises. Leaked certificates used from outside GCP and outside the authorized IP ranges (for example, from addresses outside your company) are still denied access.

Outbound access may be restricted by a higher priority firewall rule. Internet access is allowed if no other firewall rules deny outbound traffic and if the instance has an external IP address or uses a NAT instance. • The implied deny ingress rule: An ingress rule whose action is deny, source is 0.0.0.0/0, and priority is the lowest possible (65535) protects all instances by blocking incoming traffic to them. Incoming access may be allowed by a higher priority rule. Note that the default network includes some additional rules that override this one, allowing certain types of incoming traffic.

    "rationale": "GKE Sandbox provides an extra layer of security to prevent untrusted code from affecting the host kernel on your cluster nodes. When you enable GKE Sandbox on a Node pool, a sandbox is created for each Pod running on a node in that Node pool. In addition, nodes running sandboxed Pods are prevented from accessing other GCP services or cluster metadata. Each sandbox uses its own userspace kernel. Multi-tenant clusters and clusters whose containers run untrusted workloads are more exposed to security vulnerabilities than other clusters. Examples include SaaS providers, web-hosting providers, or other organizations that allow their users to upload and run code. A flaw in the container runtime or in the host kernel could allow a process running within a container to 'escape' the container and affect the node's kernel, potentially bringing down the node. The potential also exists for a malicious tenant to gain access to and exfiltrate another tenant's data in memory or on disk, by exploiting such a defect. Impact: Using GKE Sandbox requires the node image to be set to Container-Optimized OS with containerd (cos_containerd). It is not currently possible to use GKE Sandbox along with the following Kubernetes features: • Accelerators such as GPUs or TPUs • Istio • Monitoring statistics at the level of the Pod or container • Hostpath storage • Per-container PID namespace • CPU and memory limits are only applied for Guaranteed Pods and Burstable Pods, and only when CPU and memory limits are specified for all containers running in the Pod • Pods using PodSecurityPolicies that specify host namespaces, such as hostNetwork, hostPID, or hostIPC • Pods using PodSecurityPolicy settings such as privileged mode • VolumeDevices • Portforward • Linux kernel security modules such as Seccomp, Apparmor, or Selinux Sysctl, NoNewPrivileges, bidirectional MountPropagation, FSGroup, or ProcMount",
