A new function 'os_login_shadow_group_empty' is proposed to check if the shadow group in the OS Login is empty. This function can be implemented using the 'gcloud compute os-login describe-profile' command.\n\nCoverage Analysis:\n- Coverage Score: 2/10\n- Existing Functions Mapped: 0 (None)\n- Unmapped Potential Functions: 0 (None)\n- New Functions Proposed: 1 (os_login_shadow_group_empty)\n\nTotal Coverage: The combination of mapped existing functions + unmapped potential functions + new proposed functions should provide comprehensive compliance coverage."
