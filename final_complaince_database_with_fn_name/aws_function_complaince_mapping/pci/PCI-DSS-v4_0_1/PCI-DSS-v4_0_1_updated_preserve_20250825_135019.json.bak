Ideally, such systems are placed within a dedicated trusted network that is public facing (for example, a DMZ) but that is separated via NSCs from more sensitive internal systems, which helps protect the rest of the network in the event these externally accessible systems are compromised.

Any disabling or altering of these security controls, including on administrators\u2019 own devices, is performed by authorized personnel. It is recognized that administrators have privileges that may allow them to disable security controls on their own computers, but there should be alerting mechanisms in place when such controls are disabled and follow up that occurs to ensure processes were followed.",

These security controls may be temporarily disabled only if there is legitimate technical need, as authorized by management on a case-by-case basis.

The storage of SAD data prior to the completion of the authorization process is also included in the data retention and disposal policy so that storage of this sensitive data is kept to minimum, and only retained for the defined amount of time. Account data storage is kept to a minimum through implementation of data retention and disposal policies, procedures, and processes that include at least the following: \u2022 Coverage for all locations of stored account data. \u2022 Coverage for any sensitive authentication data (SAD) stored prior to completion of authorization. \u2022 Limiting data storage amount and retention time to that which is required for legal or regulatory, and/or business requirements. \u2022 Specific retention requirements for stored account data that defines length of retention period and includes a documented business justification. \u2022 Processes for secure deletion or rendering account data unrecoverable when no longer needed per the retention policy. \u2022 A process for verifying, at least once every three months, that stored account data exceeding the defined retention period has been securely deleted or rendered unrecoverable.",

For example, in an m-of-n scheme (for example, Shamir), where only two of any three components are required to reconstruct the cryptographic key, a custodian must not have current or prior knowledge of more than one component. If a custodian was previously assigned component A, which was then reassigned, the custodian should not then be assigned component B or C, as this would give the custodian knowledge of two components and the ability to recreate the key.",

This bullet is a best practice until its effective date; refer to applicability notes below for details.\n\u2022 The protocol in use supports only secure versions or configurations and does not support fallback to, or use of insecure versions, algorithms, key sizes, or implementations.\n\u2022 The encryption strength is appropriate for the encryption methodology in use.",

    "Purpose": "Sensitive information must be encrypted during transmission over public networks because it is easy and common for a malicious individual to intercept and/or divert data while in transit.",
    "GoodPractice": "The network and data-flow diagrams defined in Requirement 1 are useful resources for identifying all connection points where account data is transmitted or received over open, public networks. While not required, it is considered a good practice for entities to also encrypt PAN over their internal networks, and for entities to establish any new network implementations with encrypted communications. PAN transmissions can be protected by encrypting the data before it is transmitted, or by encrypting the session over which the data is transmitted, or both. While it is not required that strong cryptography be applied at both the data level and the session level, it is strongly recommended. If encrypted at the data level, the cryptographic keys used for protecting the data can be managed in accordance with Requirements 3.6 and 3.7. If the data is encrypted at the session level, designated key custodians should be assigned responsibility for managing transmission keys and certificates.",
    "CustomizedApproachObjective": "Cleartext PAN cannot be read or intercepted from any transmissions over open, public networks.",
    "ApplicabilityNotes": "Some protocol implementations (such as SSL, SSH v1.0, and early TLS) have known vulnerabilities that an attacker can use to gain access to the cleartext data. It is critical that entities maintain awareness of industry-defined deprecation dates for the cipher suites they are using and are prepared to migrate to newer versions or protocols when older ones are no longer deemed secure. Verifying that certificates are trusted helps ensure the integrity of the secure connection. To be considered trusted, a certificate should be issued from a trusted source, such as a trusted certificate authority (CA), and not be expired. Up-to-date Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs) or Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) can be used to validate certificates. Techniques to validate certificates may include certificate and public key pinning, where the trusted certificate or a public key is pinned either during development or upon its first use. Entities can also confirm with developers or review source code to ensure that clients and servers reject connections if the certificate is bad. For browser-based TLS certificates, certificate trust can often be verified by clicking on the lock icon that appears next to the address bar. A self-signed certificate may also be acceptable if the certificate is issued by an internal CA within the organization, the certificate\u2019s author is confirmed, and the certificate is verified\u2014for example, via hash or signature\u2014and has not expired. The bullet above (for confirming that certificates used to safeguard PAN during transmission over open, public networks are valid and are not expired or revoked) is a best practice until 31 March 2025, after which it will be required as part of Requirement 4.2.1 and must be fully considered during a PCI DSS assessment.",

For example, 1) dividing mission-critical functions and information system support functions among different individuals and/or functions, 2) establishing roles such that information system support activities are performed by different functions/individuals (for example, system management, programming, configuration management, quality assurance and testing, and network security), and 3) ensuring security personnel administering access control functions do not also administer audit functions.

    "Examples": "The type of inspection will depend on the device. For instance, photographs of devices known to be secure can be used to compare a device\u2019s current appearance with its original appearance to see whether it has changed. Another option may be to use a secure marker pen, such as a UV light marker, to mark device surfaces and device openings so any tampering or replacement will be apparent. Criminals will often replace the outer casing of a device to hide their tampering, and these methods may help to detect such activities. Device vendors may also provide security guidance and 'how to' guides to help determine whether the device has been subject to tampering. Signs that a device might have been tampered with or substituted include: unexpected attachments or cables plugged into the device, missing or changed security labels, broken or differently colored casing, changes to the serial number or other external markings.",

The acknowledgment from the TPSP evidences the TPSP\u2019s commitment to maintaining proper security of the account data that it obtains from its customers. The TPSP\u2019s internal policies and procedures related to their customer engagement process and any templates used for written agreements should include provision of an applicable PCI DSS acknowledgement to its customers.

    "Purpose": "If a TPSP does not provide the necessary information to enable its customers to meet their security and compliance requirements, the customers will not be able to protect cardholder data nor meet their own contractual obligations.",

If the TPSP did not undergo a PCI DSS assessment, they may be able to provide other sufficient evidence to demonstrate that it has met the applicable requirements without undergoing a formal compliance validation. For example, the TPSP can provide specific evidence to the entity\u2019s assessor so the assessor can confirm applicable requirements are met. Alternatively, the TPSP can elect to undergo multiple on-demand assessments by each of its customers\u2019 assessors, with each assessment targeted to confirm that applicable requirements are met.
