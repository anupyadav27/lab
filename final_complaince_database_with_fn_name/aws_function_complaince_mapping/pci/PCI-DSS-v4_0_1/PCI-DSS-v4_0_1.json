    "GoodPractice": "System components that provide publicly accessible services, such as email, web, and DNS servers, are the most vulnerable to threats originating from untrusted networks. Ideally, such systems are placed within a dedicated trusted network that is public facing (for example, a DMZ) but that is separated via NSCs from more sensitive internal systems, which helps protect the rest of the network in the event these externally accessible systems are compromised. This functionality is intended to prevent malicious actors from accessing the organization's internal network from the Internet, or from using services, protocols, or ports in an unauthorized manner.

    "Purpose": "Computing devices that are allowed to connect to the Internet from outside the corporate environment—for example, desktops, laptops, tablets, smartphones, and other mobile computing devices used by employees—are more vulnerable to Internet-based threats. Use of security controls such as host-based controls (for example, personal firewall software or end-point protection solutions), network-based security controls (for example, firewalls, network-based heuristics inspection, and malware simulation), or hardware, helps to protect devices from Internet-based attacks, which could use the device to gain access to the organization’s systems and data when the device reconnects to the network.",

Where there is a legitimate need to temporarily disable security controls on a company-owned or employee-owned device that connects to both an untrusted network and the CDE—for example, to support a specific maintenance activity or investigation of a technical problem—the reason for taking such action is understood and approved by an appropriate management representative. Any disabling or altering of these security controls, including on administrators’ own devices, is performed by authorized personnel. It is recognized that administrators have privileges that may allow them to disable security controls on their own computers, but there should be alerting mechanisms in place when such controls are disabled and follow up that occurs to ensure processes were followed.",
    "Examples": "Practices include forbidding split-tunneling of VPNs for employee-owned or corporate-owned mobile devices and requiring that such devices boot up into a VPN. These security controls may be temporarily disabled only if there is legitimate technical need, as authorized by management on a case-by-case basis.

The storage of SAD data prior to the completion of the authorization process is also included in the data retention and disposal policy so that storage of this sensitive data is kept to minimum, and only retained for the defined amount of time. Account data storage is kept to a minimum through implementation of data retention and disposal policies, procedures, and processes that include at least the following: • Coverage for all locations of stored account data. • Coverage for any sensitive authentication data (SAD) stored prior to completion of authorization. • Limiting data storage amount and retention time to that which is required for legal or regulatory, and/or business requirements. • Specific retention requirements for stored account data that defines length of retention period and includes a documented business justification. • Processes for secure deletion or rendering account data unrecoverable when no longer needed per the retention policy. • A process for verifying, at least once every three months, that stored account data exceeding the defined retention period has been securely deleted or rendered unrecoverable.",

No single person can access or use the authentication factor (for example, the password, PIN, or key) of another.",
    "GoodPractice": "Where key components or key shares are used, procedures should ensure that no single custodian ever has access to sufficient key components or shares to reconstruct the cryptographic key. For example, in an m-of-n scheme (for example, Shamir), where only two of any three components are required to reconstruct the cryptographic key, a custodian must not have current or prior knowledge of more than one component. If a custodian was previously assigned component A, which was then reassigned, the custodian should not then be assigned component B or C, as this would give the custodian knowledge of two components and the ability to recreate the key.",

    "RequirementID": "4.2.1",
    "DefinedApproachRequirements": "4.2.1 Strong cryptography and security protocols are implemented as follows to safeguard PAN during transmission over open, public networks:\n• Only trusted keys and certificates are accepted.\n• Certificates used to safeguard PAN during transmission over open, public networks are confirmed as valid and are not expired or revoked. This bullet is a best practice until its effective date; refer to applicability notes below for details.\n• The protocol in use supports only secure versions or configurations and does not support fallback to, or use of insecure versions, algorithms, key sizes, or implementations.\n• The encryption strength is appropriate for the encryption methodology in use.",
    "DefinedApproachTestingProcedures": "4.2.1.a Examine documented policies and procedures and interview personnel to verify processes are defined to include all elements specified in this requirement.\n4.2.1.b Examine system configurations to verify that strong cryptography and security protocols are implemented in accordance with all elements specified in this requirement.\n4.2.1.c Examine cardholder data transmissions to verify that all PAN is encrypted with strong cryptography when it is transmitted over open, public networks.\n4.2.1.d Examine system configurations to verify that keys and/or certificates that cannot be verified as trusted are rejected.",
    "Purpose": "Sensitive information must be encrypted during transmission over public networks because it is easy and common for a malicious individual to intercept and/or divert data while in transit.",
    "GoodPractice": "The network and data-flow diagrams defined in Requirement 1 are useful resources for identifying all connection points where account data is transmitted or received over open, public networks. While not required, it is considered a good practice for entities to also encrypt PAN over their internal networks, and for entities to establish any new network implementations with encrypted communications. PAN transmissions can be protected by encrypting the data before it is transmitted, or by encrypting the session over which the data is transmitted, or both. While it is not required that strong cryptography be applied at both the data level and the session level, it is strongly recommended. If encrypted at the data level, the cryptographic keys used for protecting the data can be managed in accordance with Requirements 3.6 and 3.7. If the data is encrypted at the session level, designated key custodians should be assigned responsibility for managing transmission keys and certificates.",
    "CustomizedApproachObjective": "Cleartext PAN cannot be read or intercepted from any transmissions over open, public networks.",
    "ApplicabilityNotes": "Some protocol implementations (such as SSL, SSH v1.0, and early TLS) have known vulnerabilities that an attacker can use to gain access to the cleartext data. It is critical that entities maintain awareness of industry-defined deprecation dates for the cipher suites they are using and are prepared to migrate to newer versions or protocols when older ones are no longer deemed secure. Verifying that certificates are trusted helps ensure the integrity of the secure connection. To be considered trusted, a certificate should be issued from a trusted source, such as a trusted certificate authority (CA), and not be expired. Up-to-date Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs) or Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) can be used to validate certificates. Techniques to validate certificates may include certificate and public key pinning, where the trusted certificate or a public key is pinned either during development or upon its first use. Entities can also confirm with developers or review source code to ensure that clients and servers reject connections if the certificate is bad. For browser-based TLS certificates, certificate trust can often be verified by clicking on the lock icon that appears next to the address bar. A self-signed certificate may also be acceptable if the certificate is issued by an internal CA within the organization, the certificate’s author is confirmed, and the certificate is verified—for example, via hash or signature—and has not expired. The bullet above (for confirming that certificates used to safeguard PAN during transmission over open, public networks are valid and are not expired or revoked) is a best practice until 31 March 2025, after which it will be required as part of Requirement 4.2.1 and must be fully considered during a PCI DSS assessment.",
    "Examples": "Open, public networks include, but are not limited to:\n• The Internet\n• Wireless technologies, including Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, cellular technologies, and satellite communications.",
    "FurtherInformation": "Vendor recommendations and industry best practices can be consulted for information about the proper encryption strength specific to the encryption methodology in use. For more information about strong cryptography and secure protocols, see industry standards and best practices such as NIST SP 800-52 and SP 800-57.

    "GoodPractice": "The following items should be considered for inclusion in code reviews: • Searching for undocumented features (implant tools, backdoors). • Confirming that software securely uses external components’ functions (libraries, frameworks, APIs, etc.). For example, if a third-party library providing cryptographic functions is used, verify that it was integrated securely. • Checking for correct use of logging to prevent sensitive data from getting into logs. • Analysis of insecure code structures that may contain potential vulnerabilities related to common software attacks identified in Requirement 6.2.4. • Checking the application’s behavior to detect logical vulnerabilities.",

    "Purpose": "Classifying the risks (for example, as critical, high, medium, or low) allows organizations to identify, prioritize, and address the highest risk items more quickly and reduce the likelihood that vulnerabilities posing the greatest risk will be exploited.",
    "GoodPractice": "Methods for evaluating vulnerabilities and assigning risk ratings will vary based on an organization’s environment and risk-assessment strategy.\nWhen an entity is assigning its risk rankings, it should consider using a formal, objective, justifiable methodology that accurately portrays the risks of the vulnerabilities pertinent to the organization and translates to an appropriate entity-assigned priority for resolution.\nRisk rankings should, at a minimum, identify all vulnerabilities considered to be a “high risk” to the environment. In addition to the risk ranking, vulnerabilities may be considered “critical” if they pose an imminent threat to the environment, impact critical systems, and/or would result in a potential compromise if not addressed. Examples of critical systems may include security systems, public-facing devices and systems, databases, and other systems that store, process, or transmit cardholder data.",
    "CustomizedApproachObjective": "New system and software vulnerabilities that may impact the security of cardholder data and/or sensitive authentication data are monitored, cataloged, and risk assessed.",
    "ApplicabilityNotes": "An organization’s processes for managing vulnerabilities should be integrated with other management processes—for example, risk management, change management, patch management, incident response, application security, as well as proper monitoring and logging of these processes. This process should include multiple sources of vulnerability information, including industry-recognized vulnerability databases (for example, the US National Vulnerability Database), CERTs, RSS feeds, information received from vendors and third parties, and vulnerabilities identified via internal and external vulnerability scans (Requirements 11.3.1 and 11.3.2). This will help to ensure all vulnerabilities are properly identified and addressed.\nProcesses should support ongoing evaluation of vulnerabilities. For example, a vulnerability initially identified as low risk could become a higher risk later. Additionally, vulnerabilities individually considered to be low or medium risk, could collectively pose a high or critical risk if present on the same system, or if exploited on a low-risk system that could result in access to the CDE.\nThis requirement is not achieved by, and is in addition to, performing vulnerability scans according to Requirements 11.3.1 and 11.3.2. This requirement is for a process to actively monitor industry sources for vulnerability information and for the entity to determine the risk ranking to be associated with each vulnerability.",
    "Examples": "Some organizations that issue alerts to advise entities about urgent vulnerabilities requiring immediate patches/updates are national Computer Emergency Readiness/Response Teams (CERTs) and vendors.\nCriteria for ranking vulnerabilities may include criticality of a vulnerability identified in an alert from Forum of Incident Response and Security Teams (FIRST) or a CERT, consideration of the CVSS score, the classification by the vendor, and/or type of systems affected.",
    "FurtherInformation": "Trustworthy sources for vulnerability information include vendor websites, industry newsgroups, mailing lists, etc. If software is developed in-house, the internal development team should also consider sources of information about new vulnerabilities that may affect internally developed applications. Other methods to ensure new vulnerabilities are identified include solutions that automatically recognize and alert upon detection of unusual behavior. Processes should account for widely published exploits as well as “zero-day” attacks, which target previously unknown vulnerabilities.\nFor bespoke and custom software, the organization may obtain information about libraries, frameworks, compilers, programming languages, etc. from public trusted sources (for example, special resources and resources from component developers). The organization may also independently analyze third-party components and identify vulnerabilities.\nFor control over in-house developed software, the organization may receive such information from external sources. The organization can consider using a “bug bounty” program where it posts information (for example, on its website) so third parties can contact the organization with vulnerability information. External sources may include independent investigators or companies that report to the organization about identified vulnerabilities and may include sources such as the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) or the OWASP Risk Rating Methodology.",

    "Purpose": "Scripts loaded and executed in the payment page can have their functionality altered without the entity’s knowledge and can also have the functionality to load additional external scripts (for example, advertising and tracking, tag management systems).\nSuch seemingly harmless scripts can be used by potential attackers to upload malicious scripts that can read and exfiltrate cardholder data from the consumer browser.\nEnsuring that the functionality of all such scripts is understood to be necessary for the operation of the payment page minimizes the number of scripts that could be tampered with.\nEnsuring that scripts have been explicitly authorized reduces the probability of unnecessary scripts being added to the payment page without appropriate management approval. Where it is impractical for such authorization to occur before a script is changed or a new script is added to the page, the authorization should be confirmed as soon as possible after a change is made.\nUsing techniques to prevent tampering with the script will minimize the probability of the script being modified to carry out unauthorized behavior, such as skimming the cardholder data from the payment page.",

    "Examples": "The integrity of scripts can be enforced by several different mechanisms including, but not limited to:\n• Sub-resource integrity (SRI), which allows the consumer browser to validate that a script has not been tampered with.\n• A CSP, which limits the locations the consumer browser can load a script from and transmit account data to.\n• Proprietary script or tag-management systems, which can prevent malicious script execution.",

    "Purpose": "Defining an access control model that is appropriate for the entity’s technology and access control philosophy supports a consistent and uniform way of allocating access and reduces the possibility of errors such as the granting of excessive rights.",
    "GoodPractice": "A factor to consider when defining access needs is the separation of duties principle. This principle is intended to prevent fraud and misuse or theft of resources. For example, 1) dividing mission-critical functions and information system support functions among different individuals and/or functions, 2) establishing roles such that information system support activities are performed by different functions/individuals (for example, system management, programming, configuration management, quality assurance and testing, and network security), and 3) ensuring security personnel administering access control functions do not also administer audit functions. In environments where one individual performs multiple functions, such as administration and security operations, duties may be assigned so that no single individual has end-to-end control of a process without an independent checkpoint. For example, responsibility for configuration and responsibility for approving changes could be assigned to separate individuals.",

    "Purpose": "Assigning least privileges helps prevent users without sufficient knowledge about the application from incorrectly or accidentally changing application configuration or altering its security settings.

    "GoodPractice": "Access rights are granted to a user by assignment to one or several functions. Access is assigned depending on the specific user functions and with the minimum scope required for the job. When assigning privileged access, it is important to assign individuals only the privileges they need to perform their job (the 'least privileges'). For example, the database administrator or backup administrator should not be assigned the same privileges as the overall systems administrator. Once needs are defined for user functions (per PCI DSS requirement 7.2.1), it is easy to grant individuals access according to their job classification and function by using the already-created roles.
