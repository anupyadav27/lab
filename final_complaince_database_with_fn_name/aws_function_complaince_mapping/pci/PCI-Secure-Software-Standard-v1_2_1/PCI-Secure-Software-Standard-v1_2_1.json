For example, a built-in administrator account may require the ability to configure the software and associated user accounts, but not the ability to access areas containing sensitive data. Applying the principle of least privilege to user accounts helps prevent users without sufficient knowledge about the software from incorrectly or accidentally changing the software configuration or its security settings. Enforcing least privilege also helps to minimize the effects of unauthorized access to software user accounts. To limit access to sensitive data, functions, and resources to only those accounts that require such access, the level of privilege and access required should be defined and documented for each built-in account in an access matrix such that its assigned functions may be performed, but no additional or unnecessary access or privileges are granted."

To minimize the software attack surface, the software should be developed using secure design principles such as layered defense, application segmentation and isolation (logical), and adaptive response. Examples of software security controls include input and output validation, authentication, parameterization, escaping, segmentation, logging, etc. For guidance on implementing cyber resiliency techniques and approaches, refer to industry standards and guidance such as the current version of NIST Special Publication 800-160."

Examples of authentication methods include: • Something you know, such as a password or passphrase. • Something you have, such as a token device or smart card. • Something you are, such as a biometric. To ensure that the implemented authentication mechanisms are adequate to address the risk of unauthorized access to sensitive data or sensitive resources, or misuse of a sensitive function, the vendor should analyze threats and identify the required level of authentication for all types of users and roles. For example, a user with limited access to sensitive data and sensitive resources could be required to perform authentication using a single authentication factor (for example, a password or a passphrase) while a user that is able to export the entire database might be required to perform multi-factor authentication. Other factors such as the type of access (for example, local, non-console, or remote access) and the level of privilege (for example, the ability to invoke sensitive functions such as pause logging or change access privileges) may influence the level of authentication that should be required."

The authentication mechanism implemented in the software could rely on additional sensors to ensure the provided biometric sample is from a living human and not a forged or spoofed sample. In some use cases or deployment scenarios, an authentication mechanism that relies on a single authentication method may not be sufficient. In such circumstances, the software vendor may want to implement additional mitigation strategies (for example, multi-factor authentication mechanism). To support a claim that the implemented authentication mechanism is sufficiently strong and robust, a vendor should adopt an industry-accepted methodology for assigning assurance levels (for example, NIST SP800-63-3 and NIST SP800-63B)."

Unfortunately, each Internet accessible interface (and the functions and resources it provides) is a potential attack vector.

Secure areas or systems are those within the software architecture where the integrity of available services and data is ensured, and therefore can be relied upon by the software. Historically, web application architectures consisted of “client-side” components and “server-side” components. Client-side functions are those typically performed by a common web browser. Server-side functions are those typically performed by web, application, and/or database servers. Given the open nature and design of most common web browsers and the fact that they are maintained by end users, server-side functions are typically considered to be more secure given a software/service provider’s ability to control and secure those aspects of the software architecture. Modern web software architectures, however, have become increasingly complex with software components often deployed across multiple geographic locations and managed by multiple entities. In these circumstances, the distinction between “client-side” or “server-side” functions can be increasingly ambiguous. The term “secure area” is a reference to traditional “server-side” functions without getting into architectural specifics. Examples of a secure area include a secured server environment, a microservice, or a serverless API."

There are numerous methods to protect against serialization (and deserialization) attacks. Some programming languages, libraries, and APIs provide features and functions that are resistant to serialization attacks. Other methods include using deserialization mechanisms that only support pure data formats like JSON or XML, limiting data types allowed during object creation, encrypting communications, and authenticating API clients. Appropriate methods to protect against serialization attacks depend on the API implementation.

It is therefore important that any connection that transmits sensitive data is encrypted using strong cryptography. Common methods for achieving this will include the use of TLS using appropriate cipher suites. Although connections that do not transmit sensitive data do not explicitly require the use of encryption, it is noted that the use of strong cryptography to secure all connections is considered a best practice and should be implemented for all communications unless legitimate business or technological constraints exist that render such an approach infeasible. In most cases, however, communications between web application components include the transmission of authentication information (user credentials or session information) which is considered sensitive data by definition and should therefore be encrypted using strong cryptography."
