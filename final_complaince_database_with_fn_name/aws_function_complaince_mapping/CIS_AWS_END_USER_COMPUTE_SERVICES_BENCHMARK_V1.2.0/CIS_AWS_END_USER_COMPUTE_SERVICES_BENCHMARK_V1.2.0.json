Click Launch WorkSpaces and complete the first three steps. 3. For the WorkSpaces Configuration step, do the following: - Select the volumes to encrypt: Root Volume, User Volume, or both volumes. - For Encryption Key, select an AWS KMS CMK. The CMK that you select must be symmetric. 4. Click Next Step. 5. Click Launch WorkSpaces. NOTE: To encrypt existing AWS WorkSpaces data you must re-create the necessary WorkSpaces instances with the volumes encryption feature enabled as outlined above. From the Command line: 1. Run the create-workspaces command aws workspaces create-workspaces --workspaces DirectoryId=`your_directoryID`, UserName=`user_for_workspace`, BundleId=`bundle_to_build`, VolumeEncryptionKey=`AWS_KMS_customer_master_key_(CMK)`, UserVolumeEncryptionEnabled=`true`, RootVolumeEncryptionEnabled='true', WorkspaceProperties={RunningMode=`AUTO_STOP`, RunningModeAutoStopTimeoutInMinutes=`10`, RootVolumeSizeGib=`root_GB`, UserVolumeSizeGib=`user_GB`, ComputeTypeName=`STANDARD`}  2. You will receive output highlighting: - FailedRequests - Will contain information about the WorkSpaces that could not be created, and the command failed - PendingRequests - Will contain information about the WorkSpaces that were created and the command was successful. Default Value: By default, AWS Workspaces utilize Elastic Block Store (AWS EBS)by default to encrypt data at rest (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/workspaces/latest/adminguide/data- protection.html) AWS Workspaces utilizes TLS 1.2 encryption and SigV4 request signing by default to encrypt data in transit. The default port for encrypting data in transit is 4172 (TCP and UDP) and is set to 128bits by default. (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/workspaces/latest/adminguide/data-protection.html) For DCV, streaming and control data in-transit is encrypted using TLS 1.3 encryption for UDP traffic and TLS 1.2 encryption for TCP traffic, with AES-256 ciphers.
